Celsus, constanter seruatae erga Galbam fidei crimen (onfhssm,
&emplum ultro imputauit (i.e. he actually claimed credit for the
conduct charged against him). The conduct of Socrates on his trial
is a typical case of such acti0n3 and a Latin writer, in describing
it, would be likely to use ultro.

13. doctrina, ‘ acquired knowledge,⁷ is regularly )( ingenium,
‘natural ability ’ῑ Pol. has both.

16. diuidere, ‘to distribute ’z cf. Paul. 3 ξ 1.

Comata: part of 1110 speech made by Claudius on that occasion
(48 A.D.) is preserved 111 1110 Lyons inscription : see Furneaux, Tac.

It seems safe to infer that this sentence was written before
the invasion of Britain in 43 Α.1).

24. derige: 50 Gertz for dirige of 11155.; dirige oculos (point
the eyes in different directions) would be properly said to a squinter:
ὂς1111011οκ101 1110 meaning 15 10 ‘point or aim down' or ‘to make
straight‚' derigo should be written, the oldest mss. generally giving this
form. But by the 5th century ΑΛ), 1110 degeneracy of pronunciation
caused derigo and dirigo to be confused ” Nettleship, Lexicogr. sub η.

25. numinis: cf. 851.

26. praestringat, ‘will dazzle': this metaphorical sense is

§2 27· diebus ac noctibus, ‘night and day': ef. De Ben.

but Cic. uses noctes diesque, noctes et dies, et dies et noctes, dies
noctesque (Madv. on De Fin. i 51); and Lucr. and Virgil have
noctes atque dies. Once in the Dialogues (vii 1, 2) Sen. has dies
noctesque in this sense. He also uses per diem ac noctem, e.g. Ναί.
Quaess. vi 16, 3.
