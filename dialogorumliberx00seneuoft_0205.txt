Romans got their music and musical terminology from the Greeks.
Thus σοφῶς, often used by Romans as a term of apphmse, corre-
sponds exactly to our ‘ bravo ξ’, which was first addressed to Italian
singers and then came into common use.

²3· inertissimae : the ‘laziuess ' is not true ofthe tune but of the
man's way of life ε cf. iners 1. ²7·

²4· aliquod—metientes, ‘beating time to some unspoken
tune ’ t cf. Quint. ix 4, 51 tempora etiam animo metiuntur, et
pedum et digitorum ictu scgrmmt quibusdam notin Hor. Carm.

Ist pers. (as here), the pres. with the others. There is no difference
in meaning between the tenses, any more than between λέγοιμ’ ἄν
and εἴποιμ’ ἄν.

3. argentum, ‘their silver plate⁷: old silver, the work of
famous artists or the property of famous persons in the past, was
much prized 3 and, like the Corinthiam bronzes, was carefully arranged
on side-boards (mensae): cf. Helu. 11 ἓ 33 Dz'al. vii 17, 2 quare

was the fashion not to hide too much of it under their dress.

4. quomodo aper...exeat: this may refer to such a chef-
