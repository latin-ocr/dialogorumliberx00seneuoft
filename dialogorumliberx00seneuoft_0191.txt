§ 3. 1. quomodo...trepidarent‚ ‘ what a flutter they would be
in’ ε see n. to 3 ξ 3: for the original sense of trepidare, cf. Dz'al. v
16, 1 aues uz'scmn (bird-lime), dum trepidantes excutiunt, plumis
omnibns inlinunt: it is used also (Nat. Quaest. iii 19, 4) sor the
⁴ flapping ’ of a fish out of water.

small, last out.'

5. deficiat has the sense of defectura sit ε cf. erumperet 6 ἓ 2.

mss.‚ should be kept ε ‘they don⁷t know the answer to this
very question, whether they are robbing themselves’: cf. Catull.
17, 22 ipse qui sit, utrum sit an mm sit, id quoque nescit.

1 1. iactura. ‘detrimenti latentis, ‘ the loss of something whose
subtraction you do not notice': the expression has been suspected
and a correction proposed by Gertz, on the ground that iactura and
detrimentum are almost the same thing: but the text may be sound-

ἓ 5. 12. te z life is identified with personality.

ibit, qua. coepit, sc. ire, ‘will proceed along the path it ⁹
began on.'

13. cursum, ‘ rapid rate.'

14. nihil tumultuabitur, ‘it will make no demonstration 'z
