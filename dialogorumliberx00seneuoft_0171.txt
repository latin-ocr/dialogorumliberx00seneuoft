NOTES (c. 3 δ 2) 103

Mart. x 58, 14 et non officiosus amo (even though Ι do not call on
you, I love you).

22. manu here as osten is )( natura: the diseases are not due
to nature but have been ‘artificially’ eontracted by our vices: so
those who disinherit their children are said orbitatem manufacere

quod, ‘the time which...)

²3· uidebis: the apodosis of a conditional sentence, the
protasis being represented by the imperative which precedes: a
constr. found in many languages, e.g. ‘ask and ye shall receive.’

In Cicero’s use of this constr.‚ there is no et between the
imperative and future: and so here: but Sen. often uses such a
form as considera et intelleges (Epp. 13- 16): see Madvig Opusc. ii
ξ 162.

§3 24. quandozhow seldom.

certus consilii: objective gena for the constr.‚ cf. Virg. Aen. iv
554 certus eundi3 Tac. Ann. iv 34, 2 relinquendae uitae cerlu53
Pliny Epp. vi 16, 12 certusfugae.

26. in statu suo uoltus, ‘your face wore its natural expression’ :
in general your expression was determined by the feelings os some-
one else whom you wished to be well with: cf. Dz'al. iii 19, 2
placidus esse debet et in statu uoltus. See n. to Helu. 18 ξ 6.

Comp. Emmcz c. 13 ‘With nien he can be rational and un-
affected, but when he has ladies to please‚ every feature works.'

27. intrepidus, ‘free from excitement,' ‘calm': trepidus is
‘in a flutter’ from either hope or fear3 it means ‘frightened’ only
where the context gives it that meaning : see n. to 8 ἐξ).

facti operis : partitive after quid: ‘what you have of work done,
to show for your long life': cf. Epp. 22, 14 nemo quicquam habet
flzctz': infuturum enim nostra distulimus.

1. uanus dolor, ‘groundless sorrow‘: cf. Polyb. 18 ξ 4: some
writers, e-g. Livy, prefer uanus to falsus as the opposite of uerus.

2. blanda conuersatio, ‘the society of those whom you flatter’ :
the adj. might mean ‘who flatter you‚' but the context seems in
favour of the former meaning. blanda must have a bad sense here,
to harmonise with the three preceding epithets.
