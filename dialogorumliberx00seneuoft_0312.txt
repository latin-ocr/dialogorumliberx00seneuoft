De Ben. v 15, 63 Pliny Nat. Hz‘st. praef. ἓ 16; iii 5; Pliny Paneg.

28. quid sibi uolunt, ‘ what is the meaning 0f‚⁷ i.e. ‘how can
we account for?’

29. inter, ‘ among‚’ not ‘between.'

Macedonicus sermo, spoken by the soldiers whom Alexander
left behind in the East.

30. ferarum is ambiguous, but is probably adj„ not noun.
