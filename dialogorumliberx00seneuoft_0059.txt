NJECE AND NEPHEW li

called Novatilla, because Novatus was the name which
her father bore originally and which he may have borne
at the time of her birth. But the parentage of Marcus
is left uncertain ; and different opinions have been held.
I believe that there is evidence which proves, almost
’ conclusively, that he was the son of Mela, the poet Lucan.

Most editors of Seneca, eg. Lipsius, Haase, Thomas,
have held that Marcus was Seneca’s own son ; Gercke
also (Seneca-Studien p. 286) assumes this without dis-
cussion. Lipsius gives his reason for holding this view:
he says that Seneca could not have spoken with so
much affection of any child who was not his own. But
the argument has little force. Immediately afterwards

ἰ Seneca speaks of Novatilla, who is admitted not to have

been his daughter. He naturally does not apply to a

' girl of perhaps twelve or fourteenl quite the same terms

of endearment as to a boy of three, a child os exceptional

, charm and precocity; for, as he himself says elsewhere,
² fructuosior est adulescentia liberorum, sed infantia dulcior2;

but his expression of affection is quite as strong in one

case as in the other.
Earlier in the work Seneca mentions, with no particu-

lar expression of grief, the death of a son of his own³;
and—leaving Marcus out of the question—this is the
only record of a child born to Seneca. In connexion
with Marcus and Novatilla, he speaks of his own
orbitas ; and, though this might refer to his bereavement,
the most natural inference from the word is that he had
no children when he wrote it. Again, if Marcus was
Seneca's son, a number of difficulties arise. XVheu Cicero
was banished, it was one of his most bitter complaints
that the career of his son, Marcus, is blasted by the ruin
