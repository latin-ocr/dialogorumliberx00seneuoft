142 AD ΡΑ VLJNVM

little or no suggestion of blame: see Summers on Epp. 79, 4. The
passion of Verres for Greek works os art was called sludz'um by
himself, morbus by his friends, and latrocinium by the Sicilians
(Cic. Verr. ii 4, 1).

Vlixes cet.: sor riddles of this idle kind, cf. Epp. 88, 6, where
Sen. shows the same impatience of such enquiries: the emperor
Tiberius took an interest in them: cf. Suet. Tib. 70 grammaticos„
eiusmodi fere quaestionibus experiebatur, quae mater Hecubae, quod
Achilli nomen inter uirgines ficisset, quid Sirenes cantare sint
solitae: other like problems will be found Juv. 7, ²33- It was the
business of the grammaticus, quaestiones explicare (Quint. i ¹2³ 14):
the sensible Quintilian says (i 8, 21), mihi inter uirtutes grammatici
habebitur aliqua nescire.

remigum : Aulus Gellius (xiv 6) tells how a literary friend offered
his bulky comnionplace-book for the embellishment of the Noctes
Atticae: this book recorded, with other items of equal value‚ the
names of those sailors of Ulysses who were snatched by Scylla: the
offer was declined with thanks.

19. prior scripta esset· Ilias cet. τ the disapproval of Sen- did
not put an end to these discussions3 but they turn on real problems
of literature, and should not be ranked by him with the trivial
question of the number of Ulysses’ crew.

20. huius notae, ‘of this sort’: Sen. often uses nota (and
sors also) in this sense: cf. De Clem. ii 2, ει alia lenius notae.

21. contineas, ‘keep them to yourself‚' is )( proferas, ‘give
them to the world.'

22. non doctior uideatis sed molestior, ‘you will pass for a
bore rather than a scholar‘: Ι suppose the comparatives are due
to the phrase molesliar quam doctior in the writer’s mind.

ἓ a. 23. eocezbut now : cf. Polyb. 2 ἓ 2.

studium superuacua discendi, ‘the passion sor useless know-
ledge.'

24. his diebus, ‘lately.' Sen. may refer to an antiquarian
lecture; if he refers to conversation in society, he had good reason
sor resenting Dr Dryasdust in the drawing-mom. Aulus Gellius and
his friends appear to have talked after this fashion.

26. Duilius defeated the Carfflaginian fleet 260 B.C.

curius Dentatus triumphed over Pyrrhus 275 B.C.
