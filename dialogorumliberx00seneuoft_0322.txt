254 AD HEL VJAM

But the expression is very awkward: is it possible that
Sen. wrote ipsa, not per, or that he here used perfalsa‚ ‘very
false'?

10. porticus, ‘covered walks‚’ in which the rich took their
drives, sheltered from sun or rain: it was an object with the
luxurious to have these of great length: cf. Juv. 4, 5 quid refert
igilur quantis iumenta fatiget Ι porticibus? ; Suet. Nero 31 (of the
Golden House) tanta laxilas, ul porticus triplices miliarias (a mile
long) haberet.

expedierint: explicuerint would be more usual: but the two
verbs are akin in meaning: cs. Cic. Ad Fam. xiii 26, 2 ut negotia
explices et expedias.

11. quo latius uicos porrexerint, ‘the wider they make their
streets’: elsewhere uici are the public streets; but, to agree with
the context, these uici must belong to the rich man and form some
part of his great mansion. Sen. (Epp.·9o, 43) speaks of domos instar
urbium (town-houses as big as cities); the parts of such a domus
might satirieally be called uici.

quo depressiUS, ‘the deeper': cf. Dz'al. v 33, 4 pecuniam ex
omnibus metallis, quae deprimimus (we are sinking).

12. aestiuos specus, ‘ caves for summer,’ i.e. chambers under-
ground to secure coolness in hot weather. Pliny, in describing his
villas, mentions cryptoporticus (Epp. ii 17 and v 6); but these were
not underground, which the specus clearly are.

fastigia cenationum subduxerint, ‘ they rear the gables of their
banqueting-rooms⁷: for subducere, ‘to raise,’ cf. Epp. 48, 7 super-
cilia subduxz'mu53 Aulus Gellius iv 5, 4 constitit eam statuam z'n
locum editum subducendam. A commoner word here would be
eduxerint: cf. Polyb. 18 ἓ 2.

13. hoc plus erit quod, ‘so much the more there will be,
to...' : lzoc is abl. of amount of differe-nce. ⁷

caelum abscondat: of the other buildings and excavations this
is true3 but what of the uici? The result of making wider streets
is to give a larger view of the sky.

§8. 14. te has nothing to do with Helvia: Sen. is now
addressing the public, and in the ardour of his discourse has
forgotten a little about his mother.

15. ne, ‘truly.'
