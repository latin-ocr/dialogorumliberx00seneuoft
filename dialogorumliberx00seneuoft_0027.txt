MACAULA Y ΟΝ BOOKS xix

terms‚ with their superiors in rank, and contrasts with
this the easy, delightful, and profitable intercourse
which any man, who can read, may enjoy at any time
with the choicest spirits of past ages. Cicero loved
books and has said noble things about them1; but
Seneca was perhaps the first to state this truth, which is
quite true though it is generally ignored, so fully and
clearly. Since his time, it has been repeated in all ages by
the lovers of books. Few have proclaimed it with more elo-
quence and conviction than ourown Macaulay and Ruskin.

The first says:

‘ Time glides on; fortune is inconstant; tempers
are soured ; bonds which seemed indissoluble are daily
sundered by interest, by emulation, or by caprice. But
no such change can affect the intercourse which we hold
with the highest of human intellects. That placid inter-
course is disturbed by no jealousies or resentments.
These are the old friends who are never seen with new
faces, who are the same in wealth and in poverty, in
glory and in obscurity. With the dead there is no rivalry.
In the dead there is no change. Plato is never sullen.
Cervantes is never petulant. Demosthenes never comes
unseasonably, Dante never stays too long. No differ-
ence of political opinion can alienate Cicero. No heresy
can excite the horror of Bossuet².'

2 Essay on Bacon. This Essay was written in India, where
Macaulay read Seneca through at least once. He is hard on
Seneca, calls him ‘an affected empty scribbler,' and writes
to Ellis (May 30, 1836), ¹ Ι cannot bear Seneca. . . .His works
are made up of mottoes. There is hardly a sentence which
might not be quoted; but to read him straight forward is
like dining on nothing but anchovy sance ’ (Life 1 pp. 448,
449). Yet Macaulay must have heartily agreed with Seneca's
love of books.
