²3· diripitur, lit. ⁴ is torn to pieces‚’ i.e. is in immense demand,
everybody wishing to secure him: cf. Dz'al. v 23, 5 tota ciuitate
direptus cst (the whole town scrambled for him) 3 Stat. Sila. v 3, 130
Maeoniden...urbes 1 diripiunt (compete to possess Homer); Mart.
vii 76 le diripiam potentiores. The meaning is only half metaphorical
in Sen. Epp. 74, 7 hanc 2⁵721qu'1zenta722'1720 suo propone, ludos facere

and not metaphorical at all in Quint. vi 1, 47 (children having been
brought into a law-court to increase the effect of an appeal sor
inercy, the prosecutor managed to spoil the effect) pueris in epilogum
praeludis, talos iecit in medium, quos illi diripere coeperunt.

24. omnia, ⁶ all the place ’ t common in all Latin. Many pas-

completzeauses to be crammed; for he does not take up the
space himself. Similar idioms are common in silver Latin t see n.

the breakage is due to the demonstrations of the audience, not to the
reciter himself.

25. res proferentur, ‘ will the Terrn end ³ : rerum prolatio was
the lawyers' vacation.

Polyb. 2 §6 This clause refers to the preceding optat, not to timet.

2. ad satietatem, ‘ till he has had enough‘ : the word ‘satiety'

inan, who orders his life on principle and presumably does not
indulge in any pleasure to excess.
