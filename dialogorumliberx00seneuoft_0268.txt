refers to Gryllus, father of Xenophon, De Ben. iii 32, 3. Ι suspect

fact about Gryllus.

2 1. quid. governs noui.

ἕ 3. 24. rem maioris prudentiae: words which show greater
wisdom z gen. of quality.

For mm z uocem (which Gertz would prefer), cf. De Bm. vii 1 Ι, 2

Persen, dues filios z'n adoptionem dedit, duos, quos silai sca-nazcerat,

semper& : cs. ξ 5.

ἓ 5. 14. quaestoelebrata sunt, ‘the farne of which has been
