NOTES (cv 2§4) 231

14. uirum: there is a little awkwardness in the repetition of
uirum below in a different sense. also preceded by a superlative.

aduentum: if the uncle was Seneca’s uncle, he was probably
returning from Egypt: cf. 19 ἓ 4: if he was Helvia's uncle,
which the text certainly suggests, the circumstances are unknown.

16. diducendo, ‘by dividing it‚’ i.e. by leaving an interval
between her blows.

17. uirum: Lucius Annaeus Seneca: see Introd. p. xxxvii.

trium liberorum: Marcus Novatus (later by adoption Junius
Gallio), Lucius Annaeus Seneca, and Marcus Annaeus Mela: see
Introd. p. xli.

ἓ 5. 18. lugenti, ‘when you were mourning already' for the
uncle.

nuntiatus shows that Helvia and her husband were apart at the

may have been at Corduba, the other at Rome3 but the facts are
not known.

sermonibus el de industria mm inuenientibus exitum. Sen. also
uses ex industria.

20. coniectis, ‘concentrated‚’ is )( diducas.

22. modo modo: see n. to Paul. 18 ἓ 5.

23- tres nepotes: whose children these were, is not stated:

of them. emiseras probably means that the boys had grown out of
infancy, so that Helvia no longer carried them in her arms.

Epp. vi 26, 3 milli nepotes tuos ex uestro sinu sumere continget.

classem cum cineribus Germanici, miserantibus cunctis, quod.. ferales
reliquias sim! ferret3 Lucan ix 60 ossibus el tepida uestes implere
