SENECA AND CLA VDJVS xxv

laid on this, as a short time might well seem long in such
circumstances. More light is thrown on the question of
date by the prayer that Claudius may ‘ open up ' or
‘unlock' Britain1. This would not have been said,
unless it were known that an invasion was intended;
nor would it have been said by a tactful writer after the
successful campaign was over and Claudius had returned
to Rome to celebrate his triumph. The conquest of
Britain was the chief boast and glory of the reign of
Claudius. In the language of all courtiers, and of all
exiles who hoped for restoration, Britain had been
‘opened up' once for all by the emperor. As the
conquest of Britain took place in the summer of 43 A.D.‚
it is probable that the treatise was written a few months
earlier. Seneca had then been in Corsica, perhaps as
long as two years, but the time of year at which he
was banished is unknown.

Seneca upon Claudius.

It is shown in the commentary how flatly Seneca
contradicts himself in the language he uses at different
times about Claudius. Here Claudius is the mildest and
gentlest of sovereigns and is praised especially for his
powers of memory and eloquence. In the Apocolocynto-

cruelty and to ridicule for his inability even to express
himself intelligibly : he is both brute and fool. Excuses
can be made for Seneca's weakness : he wrote the treatise
under the pressure of hope, and the satire under the
pressure of fear ; for he must have known by that time

² Le. ¹ Pumpkinification,' a parody of apotheosis: this
name is given it in Dion Cassius, but in Seneca's mss. it is
called Ludus De M orte Claudii. It was written for performance
at the Saturnalia of 54 A.D.
