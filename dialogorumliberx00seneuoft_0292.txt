224 AD POL YBJVM

page 59

1. qualis sperari potuerit, ‘what a future it was possible to
expect sor him.'

quid—posset : though the order of words is very harsh, I believe
that Sen. means: quid de illo non sponderi posset, tuto fratre, i.e.
if you lived, your influence made his advancement certain. Strange
as this is, it seems to me less strange than that fratre, placed where
,it is, should agree with illa.

I should also expect this closing sentence to contain a compliment
to Polybius, which it does not, if luto is an adv. qualisying sponderi.
It is possible that (Icto and sponderi should be transposed.

ἓ 9. 3. utcumque potui, ‘as best Ι could ³ under present circum-
stanees.

longo iam situ : see Introd. p. xxiv.

situs, lit. ‘mould,⁷ hence ‘disuse.'

4. hebetato animo: cf. Thyestes 923 (to a restored exile) pectora
longis hebetata malis, 1 iam sollicitas ponite curas, Cic. Ad Aa.
iii 7, 3 (writing in exile) plura scriberem, nisi milti dolor meus cum
omnis partis mentis, lum maxime buius generis slzcttllatem ademisset.

respondere, ‘to come up to‚' ‘to be on a level with‘: this
meaning is found in Cicero, e.g. Tusc. Disp. i 3 uec lamen, siqui
magnis ingeniis in eo genere extiterunt, non satis Graecorum gloriae
responderunt. The order of respondere and mederi is reversed in
what follows, by the figure called clziasmus.

6. uacare, ‘to hzlve leisure for’: cf. Paul. 14 ἓ 1: he cannot
have ‘a mind at leisure from itself, to soothe and sympathise.’

8. latina uerba=correet language: Sen. does not mean that
he has forgotten his mother tongue, but that he is afraid os lapsing
into barbarisms and solecisms in the use of it: cf. Cic. De Opt. Gen.
Or. 4 pure et emendate loquentes, quod est, lalz'ne; Herenn. iv 17
uitia in sermone, quo minus is latinus sil, duo possunt esse: soloe-
cz'smus et barbarismus3 Mart. ii 8, 2 latina parum (bad grammar).

barbarorum : cf. Helu. 7 g 9.

9. grauis, ‘ unpleasing.⁷

10. fremitus, lit. ‘howling‘ z used of wild animals, or stormy
scas and winds, or an angry crowd: here it implies loud and

unintelligible sound.
