NOTES (c. 9 ξ 3) 255

17. Romuli casam : a wooden hut with a thatched roof on the
Palatine Hill‚ revered for its supposed connexion with the beginnings
of Roman history : it was thought typieal of the simplieity of earlier
times: cf. Val. Max. iv 4, 11 per Romuli casam perque ueteris
Capitolii humilia tecta ium, nullas diuitias talium uirorum pauper·
tati posse praeferri. An exile, compelled to live in a hut, might
console himself (perhaps there had been an actual instance of this
happening) by recalling that the sacred dwelling of Romulus was
just as humble3 but, says Sen.‚ there are much higher sources of
consolation than that.

18. istud is used with the sense of lwc, as not uncornmonly in
Seneca, Lucan, and later writers.

nempe uirtutes recipit, ‘ offers, Ι suppose, a roos to the Virtues.’

19. iam, ‘ soon‚⁷ when the Virtues have taken up house there.

2ο, 21. iustitia: three of the cardinal virtues, δικαιοσύνη, σω-
φροσύνη, σοφία, are mentioned3 the fourth, fortitudo, ἀνδρεία, is
rather strangely omitted : the exile would need it.

2ο. cum, ‘when'

21. prudentia, ‘wisdorn ²: used strictly, ἰῒεφρόνησις, while
sapientia = σοφία.

omnium—ratio, ‘ a system for apportioning all duties aright ’ ε
i.e. a system of ethics.

22. humanorum diuinorumque scientia, ‘the knowledge of
God ancl man’ (the adjectives are, of course, neuter) : this is a Stoic
definition of philosophy, ἐμπειρία τῶν θείων καὶ ἀνθρωπίνων. Cf.
Epp. 89, 5 sapientia est, nosse diuina et lzzlmana et horum causas3
Cic. De Off ii 5 sapientia est, ut a ueteribus philosophis definitum
est, rerum diuinarum et humanarum scientim T uss. Disp. iv 573
Quint. xii 2, 8 nt oratoris m'ta (practical life) cum scientia diuinarum
rerum sz't humanarumque coniuncta.

2 3. tam magnarum for tantarum: see n. to Polyb. 14 ξ 1.

24. turbam, ‘ company ’z the word has here no sense of
crowding or disorder: elsewhere he speaks of comitatus virtutum
(Epp. 67, 103 90, 3). Cicero (De Off iii 116) speaks of the parts
of σωφροσύνη as uirtutum chorus, and has the same phrase in Tusc.
Disp. v 13 of constantia, grauitas, fortitudo, sapientia.

capit, ‘ can hold’ : see n. to Paul. 7 ξ 9.

ξ 4. 26. de uirtute: cf. Cic. De Fz'n. i 8 (to Brutus) z'dfizcz'o
