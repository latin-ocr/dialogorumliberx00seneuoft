lviii [NTRODUCTJON

Each of these eight readings consists of Latin words, but
each of them makes nonsense of the text. There are
few Latin writings where the process of interpolation
has gone to such lengths or where it can be so clearly

traced.
To a critic, whose object it is to restore what Seneca

wrote, such readings as these are of no value at all z it
is his duty to ignore them altogether and to fix his
attention on the original from which they are derived.
If he knows Latin and considers the sense, it will not take
him long to find out from A that Seneca wrote consalu-
taboaoe but no critic, not even a Bentley or a Madvig,
could recognise commutabor under the disguise os qnae
sua sunt requirat.

Yet, in spite of the clear and incontestable superiority
of A, a number of the readings now printed in every text
of Seneca are not found in A but are due to one or more
of the interpolated mss. Thus in vi 11 §§3 and 4 A
wrongly gives fragoris for frigori& praecare for precarii,
animali for animast and it stands alone, or nearly s,o,
in these certain errors. Critics are not agreed as to the
source of these corrections; but Madvig and Gert2‚ the
two most competent judges, are both of opinion, that
every one of thern is due to conjecture by Italian scholars
living about the time of the Renaissance‚ and that none
of the inferior mss. represents an independent tradition
of antiquity. The corrections are generally such as could
be made by any attentive reader with a competent
knowledge of Latin. GertZ, who originally shared
Madvig's opinion that all existing mss, of the Dialogues
are derived from A, has been led by further study to
modify this position; but he still maintains that no
other ms. except A offers any sure ground for the critic
who seeks to purity Seneca’s textl.
