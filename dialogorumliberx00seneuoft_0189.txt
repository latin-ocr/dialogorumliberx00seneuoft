NOTES (c. 7§9) 121

percepta, ‘enjoyed ’ : in Cicero, percipio is used as freely os pain
as of pleasure: in Sen.‚ the sense tends to be less neutral:
cf. Epp. 99, 4 non computant quantum perceperz'nt3 ibid. 5 ingrati
aduersus percepta (past pleasure) sumus.

de cetero, ‘ as to the rest,': ‘in future ' : cf. Dz'al. iii 8, 1 once you
indulge anger, faciet dc cetero quantum uolet, non quantum permiserim
Cic. Ad Ast. vii, 10 de reliquo qnid agam nescio.

3. Fors Fortuna : the name by which Fortune was worshipped
at Rome.

ordinet, ‘may dispose ': potential subj.

iam is the emphatic word⁷ not nita.

4. huic cet.‚ ‘in the case of such a life, no subtraction lS
possible; addition is, but only in the sense in which....’ That uitae
is to be understood with lzuic, is shown by Epp. 98, 15 ipse uitae
plenus est, cui adici nihil desiderat.

6. quod nec desiderat. et capit, ‘ which he does not want and
yet has room for’ ε for the sense of desiderare, see n. to ἓ 9.

capz'tzxwpe?‚ ‘ can hold ’ : usually with a negative in this sense.

ἓ 10. non est itaque quod... : a clumsy but common turn : cf.
2 ἓ 5 ; non est quod... is too common in Sen.

7. canos, ‘ white hairs’,: the ellipse of capillos is common:
cf. Cic. Cato 62 non cani nec rugae repenle auctoritatem adripere
possunt; Sen. Nat. Quaest. iii 29, 3 legem barbae (the necessity
of growing a beard) amorumque nondum natus inffans habet.

8. fuit, ‘has existed.'

9. a portu, ‘ as soon as he lest harbour.’

10. huc et illuc: except in this phrase, Seu. generally wrote
lzoc for huc, if his mss. can be trusted; and for illuc alone, he
almost always has illo: eg. Helu. 15 ἓ 1, 17 ἓ 3; in Caesar and
Cicero this illo is rare: the Lyons inscription, which records a
speech delivered by Claudius in 48 A.D.‚ offers the form illoc
(Furneaux Tac. 11 p. 211), which is exactly parallel to Seneca’s
lzoc: for spelling, the authority of this inscription is much greater
than that of any ms.‚ and ranks with that of the lllonumentum
Ancyrammz. The colloquial Latin of Petronius has lzoc et illoc
(c. 39) and also istoc (c. 57).

11. per eadem...egit‚ ‘has driven round and round over the
same course ³ : cf. Dz'al. vi 15, 4 it in orbem ista tempestas.
