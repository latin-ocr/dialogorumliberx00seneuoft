176 AD POL YBJVM

Lipsius is ironical in his note: ‘credamus‚ et praesertim in
liberto Claudii, qni omnes sertatim aureos floccos ab illa pecude
legebant.'

2. in tanta facilitate, ⁶ though it is so easy for him ’γε this in
is idiomatic and cannot be translated literally : cf. Paul. 9 ξ 3.

adquirendi, ‘ to make money ' : this absolute use of the verb is
common in silver-age Latin: cf. Juv. 14, 1²5 mox adquirendi
docet insatiabile uotan3 Quint. xii 7, 10 neque enim uideo, qnae
iustior adquirendi ratio quam ex honestissimo labore.

3. contemptum eius, ‘the power to despise it.⁷

ξ 4. 5. unum, ‘alone' Considering how many powerful
sreedmen there were in the palace of Claudius, this statement
seems rather imprudent in an exile’s mouth.

in principali domo, ‘in the palace’ ε cf. De Ben. vi 32, 1‹

ξὸ. 9. opinionemzfamam‚ existimationem: it is used by
Cicero in this sense with a gen„ e.g. opinio liberalitatis (a
reputation for generosity) De Off ii 32 ; but in the silver age it
is freely used with both the senses of δόξαι cf. De Ben. ii 23, 3
opinionem clientium timent (they fear to pass for dependents):
again, when Livia is described (Dial. vi 4, 3) as opinionis suae
custos diligentissima, the meaning is not (as the Bohn translator
supposes) that she was ‘ sels-opinionated.'

10. quoque, ‘ even ² : though your powers of destruction are so
great.

ipsa. is not needed after qnoque (‘even') but is osten added by
Sen.: cf. 18 § 4; Helu. 1 ξ 3.

1 1. liberalibus disciplinis: see n. to Paul. 7 ἓ 3.

12. innutritus: cf. Pliny Poneg. 16 (of Trajan) innutritus
bellicis laudibus.

innatus : see n. to sumar-iontem, Paul. ἰο ἓ ‘z ε the word implies
that Pol. was ‘ born in a library’ and that his parents were cultured
people, just as Hamilcar, father of Hannibal who was sanguini
innatus (Dial. iv 5, 4), was a man of blood.

14. emineret, ‘it rose superior': animus is probably the
subject, the metaphor officndatum being preserved.

ἕ 6. 15. longissimum illi ingenii aeuum fama promisit:
the mss. indicate this reading ; but the separation of ingen. andfama
is very harsh, even for Sem: illi ingenio (Fickert) gives a simple
sense3 aeuum ingenii has been generally adopted.
