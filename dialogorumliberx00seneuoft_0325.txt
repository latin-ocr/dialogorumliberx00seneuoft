they would be, if they had to do without Marcellus?

15. plus, i-e. more glory.

16. non potuit, ‘ could not bear‚⁷ i.e. 'found it hard,' for Brutus

19. erubuit: Sen- supposes that shame presented Caesar from
seeing Marcellus: frorn what we know of his character. it is much
more likely that he was either in a hurry, or avoided the interview
because he wished to spare Marcellus mortification.

26. nempe, ‘undoubtedly.‘

ξ 8. Africa, Hispania, Aegyptus: the historical order is not
followed: see n. to Paul. 4 ξ 5: Caesar fought first in Egypt
