180 AD POL YBJVM

tutus, ‘safe‚⁷ in the sense that the retirement of a student is safe
from many dangers: cf. Paul. 19 ἕ 1 ; Helu. 17 ξ 4.

3. luget, ‘is in mourning': see n. to Paul. 20 ἓ 3. Polybius
posses-‚ses every virtue3 but that does not secure him against
bereavement.

4. in, ‘in the case of.’ reliquis shows that at least two were
left.

5. solarem, i-e. his surviving brothers.

7. propitio caesare, ‘ while the Emperor smiles upon him':
this ought to keep him safe from any sorrow: cf. Stat. Silu. ν 1,

143 (of Abascantus, a freedman of Domitian, whose wife had died)
quid enim, quamuis infida leuisque, Ι Caesare tam dextro, posset

Fortuna timeri ?

sine dubio: used by Sen. with three meanings: (1) ‘clearly‚’
as here; De Ben. vi 23, 2; (2) ‘it is true,⁷ like quidem, in which
case a clause follows introduced by sed or uel-nm: cf. Helu. 9 ξ 7;
Epp. 53, 1 ; Nat. Quaest. vi 18, 5 3 (3) ‘forsooth'z cf. Dz'al. v, 5², 1
magnam rem sine dubio fecerimus, ss seruolum infelicem in ergastu-
lum miserimus ; Epp. 99, 14 sine dnbio multum philosophia profecit,
sz' puerum nutrici adhuc quam patri notiorem animo forti desideras ;
Epp. 48, 6. Quintilian uses the phrase repeatedly in the first two
senses; Tacitus (Agris. 45) has sine dztbz'o...‚ tamen... . In many
caseS‚ e.g. Petron. c. 31 (Tyria sine dubio est sed iam semel lota),
it is hard to determine whether the meaning is ‘beyond doubt,'
or ‘it is true.’

impotens : cf. 16 ἓ 2 and see n. to 1 ξ 3 : in Octau. 388 impotens
(polens edd.) Fortuna should be read, I think, if the writer was
trying to put an epithet from Seneca in Seneca’s mouth.
