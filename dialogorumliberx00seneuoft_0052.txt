he stands in the pillory for all time as a mocker and a
man indifferent to truth or falsehood in religious matters.

To his own countrymen he was known for a quite
different quality—for a singular amiability ot temper
which made him a general favourite. His brother
Seneca, who records this traitl, might be considered a
partial judge; but Statius, writing in 92 A.D., when
both brothers had been dead nearly thirty years, chooses
for him the same epithet, when he says?

hoc Plus qnam Senecam dedisse mundo
ant dulcem generasse Galla'onem‘ss.

When Seneca wrote this treatise, Gallio's wife had
lately died, leaving a daughter, Novatilla, whom Seneca
regarded almost as a child of his ownss.

The voyage to Egypt, which Gallio took after his
consulship, was intended as a cure tor consumption.
But neither consumption nor sever nor any form of
disease put an end to his life. He was involved in
Seneca's tall; and this was a danger, in which his
favourite specific of a voyage could do no good: inter
insanabiles morbos principis ira numeratur, says Pliny‘2.
He was forced to commit suicide in 66 A.D.5

birthday. Vollmer is therefore mistaken, when he suggests
that dulcem is a reference to poetry written by Gallio.

⁵ Jerome’s Clwom'cle, under the year 66 A.D.: Iunius
Gallio, frater Senecae, egreglus declamator, propria se manu
interfecit. (That he is called egreg. decl. is probably due to a
confusion with his adoptive father.)
