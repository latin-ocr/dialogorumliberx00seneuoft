A SCENE AT CORAVTH xliii

This inscription, which, though the meaning is not
clear, is of great importance for the chronology of Paul's
life and travels, proves that Gallio, the brother of Seneca,
was governor of Achaia when Claudius had been hailed
as imperator twenty-six times. This detail fixes the
date of the letter as the first half of 52 A.D. The term
of the governor’s office was normally one year, a period
which was probably not prolonged in Gallio’s case, if he .
suffered from malai-ia in Achaia; and it was the rule
under Claudius that such office began on July Ist. It
is therefore inferred that Gallio was governor of Achaia
from July 1st 51 to July ist 52 A.D.1

Corinth was at this time the chief city of Achaia,
and Gallio was in residence there as governor, when the
Jews of the city brought before his tribunal the apostle
Paul, who had been living at Corinth and preaching the
gospel for eighteen months past. They accused him of
‘ persuading men to worship God contrary to the laW.'
Without calling upon Paul for his defence, Gallio
dismissed the case and drove the prosecutors from the
judgment-seat2. Disorder or crime he was prepared
to deal with; but, where no Roman law had been
transgressed and it was merely a question os Jewish
religion, he was not inclined to interfere. Gallio appears
to have acted like a sensible and cautious official, who
wished to do his duty but had no mind to put his hand
into a hornets’ nest. But he has been unfortunate.
Because the episode, related by St Luke, ends in our
English version with the words, ‘ Gallio cared for none
of these things,' his name has become proverbial, and
