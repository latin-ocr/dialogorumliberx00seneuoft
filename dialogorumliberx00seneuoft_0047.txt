THE ELDER SENECA xxxix

many years earlier, in the controuersiae or ‘ mock-trials '
conducted in the schools ; and these he wrote out,
together with comments of his own, to gratify the curiosity
of his sons, when they were going through a similar course
of training. The book has reached us in a mutilated form.
The loss of the epigrams (sententiae), by which ingenious
orators sought to impart a novelty to well—worn themeS,
can easily be borne ; but the extant prefaces (epistulae)
to the separate books are so full of interesting matter
that the loss of several of them is a great missortune.
They are all addressed to his three sons. He speaks
of them as if they were just entering on public life ; yet
it is obvious that some parts of the work were written
after the fall of Sejanusl (31 A.D.), by which time his two
elder sons must have been men of forty or near it. It
is difficult to explain this contradiction: perhaps he
kept the book by him, making additions to it, for many
years. There is no evidence that he was ever an orator
himself or even took part in the mimic debates of the
schools. ¹

The reader will note that what is most interesting
to him, the personal and historica} digressions, was
not interesting to the young Senecas, who only cared
to hear how ingenious So-and-so had proved himself
in such-and—such a debate. Thus Seneca uses the
opportunity of a suasoria2 professing to address Cicero,
to give quotations from Livy, Asinius Pollio, Cremutius

if they had held the quaestorship, which they might do at
25. For Sejanus, cf. Suus. ii 12 α Seiano circumscriptus:
Controu. ix 4, 21 cum dixisset Seianianos (victims of Sejanus)
locupletes in carcere esse.
