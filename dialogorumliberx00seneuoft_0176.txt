108 AD ΡΑ VLINVM

paci et imperiozthe peaceful empire: paci Romanae might
have been used with the same meaning: cf. Dial. i 4, 14 (os the
Germans on the frontier) gentes, in quibus Romana pax desinit.

24· Rhenum, Euphraten, Danuuium: the order is again
perverse, and the statement is rhetoric, not history. The notorious
policy of Augustus was to consolidate, not to extend, the empire:
cf. Tac. Anu. i 11, 7 addiderat consilinm coercendi intra terminos
imperii.

The facts are as follows. (1) By his stepsons, Drusus and
Tiberius, Augustus waged war beyond the Rhine 13 B.C.-6 A.D.‚
when the disaster of Varus made him withdraw finally to the south
of the river. (2) The Danube was crossed only once, probably in
5 A.D.‚ by an army of Aug: cf. silon. Anc. v 48 trans Danuuium
ductus exercitus mens Dacorum gentes imperia populi Romani
perferre coegit. (3) He never fought himself or sent armies beyond
the Euphrates.

At Seneca⁷s death, Rhine‚ Danube, and Euphrates were still,
except for the conquest of Britain, the limits of the empire.

26. Murenae cet.: for conspiracies against Augustus, cf. De
Clem. i 9, 6 (where six are mentioned) and Suet. Aug. 19 (who
records eight). Sen. again disregards the order of time: the
conspiracy of Lepidus, son of the triumvir, was suppressed 30 B.C.;
that of Murena and Caepio 22 B.C.‚ and that of Egnatius 19 B.C.
(cf. Vell. Pat. ii 91).

Egnati, aliorum: Egnatiorum, the reading os A, is not confirmed,
as might appear, by Tac. Anu. i 10, 3 interfectos Romae Varrones,
Egnatios, Iulos: for Tacitus uses the plurals in the sense of
‘ conspirators like Varro Murena etc.': cf. Catilinas 5 ξι : but Sen.
could not use this plural in the case of one conspirator only, while
mentioning three others in the singular.

27. mucrones=gladii‚ by the figure called synecdoche, the part
being used for the whole: cs. Quint. viii 6, 2ο prosa, ut mucronem
pro gladio et tectum pro domo reczpl'ct, ila non puppim pro navi.

ξ 6. nondum=⁴bef0re he had....²

28. mia: Julia‚ the only child of Augustus, born 39 B.C.‚
was married successively to Marcellus, Agrippa, and Tiberius: her
dissolute conduct poisoned her father⁷s private life; she died in
hanishment ¹4 A-D.
