[VOTES (C. 2 ξ 6) 177

id egit, ⁶ he has made it his object ' : cf. Paul. 18 ξ 4.

16. meliore sui parte, i.e. animo: cf. Nat. Quaest. iprol. ἓ 14
nostri melior pars animus est: the body is pars peior (or pessima)
hominis: cf. Dz'al. iv 14, z athletae, in uilissima sui parte occupati.

compositis t see n. to Paul. 12 ἓ 4.

17. eloquentiae means rnore than our ‘eloquence‚' as it is often
used of written works: so Livy is called by Tacitus (Agrz‘c. 10)
eloquentissimus ueterum, ‘the best writer among the ancients’ ;
and Suetonius includes under the eloquentia of Caesar not only
his speeches but all his writings, including his Commentaries and
his treatise on Grammar (Suet. lul. 55).

For· the writings of Polybius, see Introd. p. xxiii.

18. litteris honor, ‘ respect for literature.'

20. gratia : ‘grace ³ or ‘ charm ' is regarded as the char-
acteristic excellence of Greek, ‘ strength ’ that of Latin : cf. Quint.
xii 10, 35 qui a Latinis exiget illam gratiam sermonis Attici, det
milti in eloquendo eandem iucunditatem (he must provide me with
sounds as melodious as those of Greek).

maximis uiris, ‘those giants' z Homer and Virgih as the
sequel shows: again one feels the want of a definite article in
Latin.

21. contulit clearly denotes a closer approach than applicuit :
‘ whose genius he has either rivalled, or...kept close to) Cicero
would write ad quornm se ingenia applicaztit.

ἓ ’1. 24. ferre te, ‘to endure your assaults.' Sen. is not quite
logical : if Fortune has uo mark for her assaults, then she does not
pick out the virtuous as her chief mark.

²5· inter ipsa, ‘even at the time of....⁷

26. quantulum erat tibi, ⁶ how little it would have eost you ⁷ :
cf. ἓ 6.

28. ratione certa, ‘on a fixed principle’ ε the double antithesis,
of the two verbs and the two adverbs, is characteristic. With this
description of Fortune, cf. Dz'al. vi 10, 6 ut uaria et libidinosa
(capricious) mancipt‘orumqne suorum neglegens domina, et poenis
et muneribus errabit.

29. temere, ‘without sufficient reason.'

D. S. 12
