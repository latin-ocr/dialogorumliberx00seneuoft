and then, dissatisfied with the result, composed a Consolatio ad-
dressed to himself, which one niay be sure that Sen. read: cf. Cic.
Ad A tt. xii 14, 3 nihil de maerore minuendo scriplum ab ullo est, quod
ego non domi tuae legerim ; scd omnem consolationem uincit dolor.
quin eliam feci, quod profecto aule me nemo, ut [jue me per litteras
consolarer, quem librum ad le millam, si descripserim librarii. The
comfort, which many mourners would now seek froin religion, the
ancients sought from philosophy.
Ἰ This shows that Sen. in his exile had access to books, whether
he found then] in Corsica or took them with him.

20. enumerem, ‘I unrolled‚’ i.e. ⁴1 read’: the words are
equivalent because the ancient book was a roll (uolumen): cf.
Cic. Tusc. Disp. i 24 enolae dc'lzgn’nler eins eum librum qui est

de animo (i.e. the Plzaedo of Plat0): so somplz'care:‘to shut⁷ a
book.

1. consolatus refers again to a formal condolence in writing:

many, at the point of death, had spoken words of comfort to the
survivors: see n. to Polyb. 12 ξ 2.

commoraretur z a sti-onger form of plorare, esp. used of lamenta-
tion over the dying or dead: cf. Livy v 39, 4 complorati omues
pariter uiui mortuique: for comploratio, cf. Polyb. 14 ξ 2.

2. in re noua, ‘where Ι had no precedent’ : the idiomatic use of
in ε cf. Paul. 9 g* 3.

ξ 3. 3. haec takes, as usual, the gender of.. the predicate.

quid, quod, ‘ besides‚’ ‘ thirdly ⁷ here : a common way of adding
a fresh detail: cf. Paul. 17 ξ 3.

4. nouis uerbis: Lucretius (i 138) complains of the same
difficulty when he has to explain in a Latin poem the philosophy
of Epicurus. But Sen. means that, whereas in most cases A is
consoling B for the loss of C, in the present case C himself is
consoling B, so that the stock arguments will not do.

5. adlocutione, ‘ condolence': see n. to Polyb. 14 ἓ ⁴2: the

noun is used in this sense as early as Catullus, 38, 7 paullum quid
lubet adlocutionis l maestius lacrimis Simonideis.
