NOTES (c. 3 ξ 5) 105

disponis, ‘you plan it out.'

tu (added by Gertz) seems to us an improvement; but Latin,
esp. in poetry‚ often omits a personal pronoun where English needs it :
cf. Mart. v 13, 9 quodsum, non potes esse (what I am, you cannot be).

16. bonae menti, ‘for wisdom,' i.e. for the study of philosophy,
which will make you a better man: bona mens occurs very often in
Sen.‚ in the sense of ‘wisdom and virtue': e.g. Epp. 16, lperseue-
randum est, donec bona mens sit, quod bona uoluntas est (till honest
endeavour in the present turn to true virtue in future).

18. uiuere has a pregnant sense, ‘to live in earnest’ : cf. ἰ ἓ 2.

20. inde...quo, ‘at a point, to which....’

uelle, ‘to intend.’

A treatise of this kind generally consists partly of praecepta,
partly of exempla: see n. to Polyb. 14 ἓ 1. Having devoted three
chapters to the first, Sen. now gives an equal space to the second.

ἓ 1. 22. potentissimiS...excidere uoces, ‘that the most power-
sul men let drop remarks' : the verb suggests that the words are not
deliberately spoken: being casual utterances‚ they are more likely
to be sincere.

23. optent, ‘pray for': cf. Epp. 95, 2 saepe aliud uolumus,
aliud optamus et uerum ne dis quidem dicimus: ‘to wish’ is a
rarer meaning of this verb.

24. interim, ‘at times': ef. Helu. 17 ἓ 1 t the classica] Latin
is interdum or aliquando.

25. fastigio: ef. Dz'al. ix 10, 6 multi sunt, quibus necessario
haerendum sit in sastzgrio suo, ex quo mm possunt nisi cadendo
descendere.

ut, ‘supposing that....'

26. 1acessat denotes less destructive power than quatiat.
