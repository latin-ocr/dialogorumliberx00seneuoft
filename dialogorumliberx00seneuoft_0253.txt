ξ 2. 2. adfectus, ‘feelings'z here esp. sorrow: seen. to Paul.
1 ξ 1.

3. secretum: a noun.

fortuna: either ‘ Fortune ' or ⁶ your high position' z but the latter
would probably need lua.

5. statim percussus, ‘the moment you were struck ' : ef. Heln.
2 ἕ 4 statim nata.

in gTadu steteris, ‘you stood your ground': cf. Dial. ii 16, 2
gladiatores fortissimos, quorum aller premit uolnus et slat in
gradu, alter respiciens od clamantem populum significat nz'lzz'l esse3
Cic. Ad All. xvi 15, 3 milli uidetur στρατύλλαξ ille (that braggart
captain) deiectus de gradu.

6. in altiorem ordinem: of an ingenuus, this would mean
that he became at least an equam but, as even this rank was rarely
bestowed on freedrnen, however great their actual power, the phrase
probably denotes no titular promotion.

7. tua studia: your proficiency in literature.

9. consumendum, ‘to be used up utterly.’

ἓ 3. 10. in luctu pari, ‘though your loss is the same ' ε luctus
here=cazcsa luctus.

13. ne conuertisses=non debuisti conuertere, ‘you ought not
to have attracted⁷z because the subj. is jussive, the negative is
ne, not non: cf. Cic. Verr. ii 3, 195 ne emissem AdAtt. ii 1, 3 aut
ne poposcisses. A large collection of jussive subjunctives is given by
Madvig on Cic. De Fin. ii 35.

For this sense of conuertere, see n. to Helu. 10 ξ 10.

14. nunc, ‘as it is,' since you lzave attracted all eyes. nunc in
this sense generally stands alone z but, for at nunc, cf. Dial. vi 20,
4; Nat. Quaesl. iv 2, 253 Cic. Ad Fam. x 28, 13 and Lucretius
often: for nunc uero, cf. De Ben. iv 3, 1; Nat. Quaest. iv 1, 3:
for nunc tamen, Helu. 18 ἓ 9; for sed nunc, Nat. Quaest. i 3, 43
Juv. 5, 141. Of nunc autem (so mss.) Ι have noticed only one
instance in Sen.: Nat. Quaest. vii 18, 1.

praestandum est, ‘you must make good’: cf. Dial. vii πο, 1
non praestant philosophi quae loquuntur.
