At Rome, legal business began very early and ended long before
dark ; but these fanatics stop on.

sua. turba ‘the crowd which escorts them-³ They get crushed,
either as deducti or as deductores ; the only difference is that, in the
former case, the look of the thing is rnore creditable.

22. elidi usuallyz‘to be crushed to death ³ ε here it is an
exaggeration for premi.

23. officia=salutandi qfficium: see n. to 3 ξ 2.

neither domus nor uilla, but lived at Rome in insulae, lit. ‘ blocks,’

foribus implies that they don’t get in.

inlidant, ⁴ bump them against’ : he thus describes the knock of
the salutator: cs. Dial. ix 12, 6 cum multorum frustra liminibus
inlisus nomenculatores persalutauit. The subject to inlidant is
cffcia.

²4· aut (so Madvig) is more likely to have dropped out after
elidant than quos which is inserted in the inferior mss.

hasta praetoris, ‘the praetor⁷s hammer': for hasta=auctiom
see n. to Juv. 3, 33. The property of certain criminals was sold
by the state3 such a sale was called sectio and the buyer sector: to
make money thus was considered disreputable.

quandoquezalz'quando‚ ‘ at some future time.'

suppuraturo, ⁴ sure to fester,' i.e. to turn out ill: Sen. applies
the word metaphorically to uoluptates (Epp. 59, 17) and hilaritas

25. exercet, ‘keeps busy’: cf. 17 ξ 6.

to the ranks of the occupati. ¹

26. uilla, lecto ε both places os comparative seclusion : callers
are rarer at a country-house than in Rome : lecto here has no refer-
ence to sleep or sickness z it was used by the student while reading
or writing: ef. Epp. 72, 2 quaedam (some kinds ol writing) lectum
et otium el secretum desiderant.

2 7. omnibus = om n ibus aliis.

28. desidiosa occupatio: ‘a busy idleness ': a variation upon
strenua inertia of Horace (Epp. i 11, 28) : cf. inquieta inertia (Dial.
ix 12, 3).
