XVIII

For you, no change in your habits (ff lffe is necessary. T lte stua⁷y
of literature will absenti you against tlte attacks os sorrow.
Write something to proloug your brother's ›netumssv ,· tlte writiugs
of men outlast anyttu'ng else tltat tlzey can make. 7 'lle day will
come when you will be able to acqm‘t Fortuna os malive against
you. Do not use your powers of mind to iuflame your own
grief; tlzouglz l do not ask yon to suppress it altogether, yet
observa moderation in z't. T lzz'nk aad talle o tell ofyour brother:
make the thought of [αὐ] a pleasure, not a pain.

T lais letter comes from an exile, stupefiea' by lcl's own εον-νοτυς and
hardly able to express himself in ln's owse lsznguage‚ surrouudea'
as lze is by barbariam.

§L 25. tibi, tua: emphatic: other people in hereavement
may have to change their way of life, but not you.
26. quoniam quidem: common in Sem: cf. Paul. 2 §53

15 ἓ 4. Val. Maximus hardly ever uses quoniam without adding

quidem : ef. quandoqm'dem.

Bentley, in his copy, always changes quoniam quidem to quamto-
quidem.
ea...studia, ‘those literary pursuits.⁷ In what follows there is

a reminiscence of Cicero's famous praise of literature (Pro Arclz. 16)

llaec studia adulescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, secundas res

ornant, aduersis pe7sugz'um ac solacium praebent, delectant duni,
non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, fiemgrz'nantur, rusti-
cantur. But how far superior to Seneca this is!
