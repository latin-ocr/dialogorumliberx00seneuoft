cf. 11 §1 ; mortalitatis exempla (Dias. vi η, 5 ; ljpp. 101, 6).

6. quidquid—extruxit is an amplification of honores, moni-
menta z ‘ all that the ambitious have either commanded by means of

decreta are compulsory votes of senate or people conferring
titles of honour on the ambitiosus: cs. De Clem. i 14, 2 Alagnos
(i-c. Pompey) ct Felices (Le. Sulla) at Angustos diximus, et ambitiosae
maiestati quidquid potuimus titulorum congessimus: the quotation
fixes the meaning of ambitio here. opera are the triumpha] arches
and other monuments erected by monarchs to their own glory: cf.
Polyb. 1 ξ 1.

8. subruitur: the verb is singular, because honores, monimenta
have been superseded by the quidquid clause.

uetustas can mean either ‘ suturity ² as here, or ⁴ antiquity' z sor

after the stronger word, demolitur.

ιι. deinde semper ulteriorzd ἀεὶ ἐπιγιγνόμενος χρόνος.

12. quoniam quidem (cf. 2 ξ 5) introduces a pair of contras-‚ted
clauses, which would be distinguished by μέν and δέ in Greek:
siquidem is often used thus

in uicino uersatur, ‘works close at hand’: cs. Dial. vi 19, 5
mala bonaque circa aliquam mersantur materiam (must have some
substance to work on) ε for the adv. in uicino, cf. Dz'al. ix 9, 1.

13· simplicius, ‘more frankly’ : cs. simplex, Helu. 19 ς’ 5.

The sentiment is common in antiquity: cf. Vell. Pat. ii 9²
praesentia inuidia, praeterita* ueneratione prosequimur 3 Mart.
v 10, 3 lci sunt inuidiae nium-um, lx'egyaele, mores, Ι praeferat
