4. comitem: as there is no question of their going anywhere
together, sociam or parll'cipem would be more normal.

ἓ 4. si nouizzsm'a noui: i.e. knowing her wisdom, Ι am sure
she will not etc. z the phrase is common ε cf. Epp. 18, 3 site bene noui,
arbitri paz-filaus sumtus esses 3 Mart. v 6, 18 si noni dominum nouem
sororum, Ι nlsro paginatam pelet libellum: for a similar phrase, cf.
Epp. 79, 7 cml ego te mm noui ant Aetna tibi saliuam monet (makes

7. spectator fui: it does not necessarily follow that Sen- was
on board the ship with her: he may only imply that he had met her ou
her landing. The circumstances are not otherwise known 3 but it is
possible that her husband died on his way home from Egypt. It
has been supposed from this passage that Sen- had been in Egypt
with his uncle3 but it does not prove this; and his language else-
where, as in his discussion of the Nile's rising (Nat. Qnaest. iv),
is not that of 0116 who had seen the country.

8. auunculum: Gertz points out that ammcnlus, a mother's

Seneca, and that Helvius was married three times: (1) to the
mother os the anonymous heroine: (2) to Helvia's mother: (3) to
the nouerca (2 ξ 4). Isso, the nummulus here is identical with the
auunculus of 2 ξ 4.

play 2 cf. Plaut. Capi. 165 ut saepe summa ingenia 2'12 occulto latent
(ι the world knows little of its greatest men ²).

12. si huic—antiquitas, ‘had she had the good fortune to
live in a past age when men were frank in admiration of great
deeds' ε whereas the present age is cynical and has little enthusiasm.
