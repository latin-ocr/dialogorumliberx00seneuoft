NOTES (c. 17 ξ 3) 289

confugiendum est: cf. Pliny Epp. viii 19, t ad mzicum doloris
leuamentum studia confngz'; Quint. vi prooem. ξ 14 credendum
doctissimis hominibus, qui unicum aduersorum solacium litteras
putauerunt.

²7· liberalia studia ε see n. to Paul. 7 ἓ 3: the context shows
that Sen. means philosophical study in particular.

28. euellent: properly said of extracting something shmp, a
sting or an arrOW, from the flesh.

30. antiquus rigor, ‘the old-fashioned strictness,’ which in-
cluded a dislike of higher education sor women.

3¹· bonas artes: cf. 9 ξ 4 : they are the same as liberalia slztdia.

non comprendim, ‘ you did not master.⁷

ἕ 4. 3. erudiri is )( imbui, the first implying thorough know-
ledge; the second, a srnattering: cf. Cic. Tusa Dz'sp. i 14 [ιη ln
dialecticis ne imbutus quidem cs? (have you not even a smattering
of logie ?)

imbuere aliquem is to do something sor the first time to a
person, who. if the thing is learning, will not get far, unless the
process is continued. In English, ‘ilnbued with a belies’ does not
convey the same meaning at all.

4. non—proferendum, ‘in that case you would not now have
to forge your armour against Fortune, but merely to bring it forth.’

5. litteris is to be taken with both the following verbs; but it
is not clear how Roman ladies ⁶ furnished themselves with literature,
with a view to lamas-ias As Sen. elsewhere (Dial. ix 9, 5) attacks
the studiosa luxuria of those, who collect books non z'n studium sed
z'n speclaculum and (ξ 7) in speciem et cultum parietum, so luxuria
may mean the same here : the books are not bought to teach wisd0m,
but to display the wealth of their owner.

7. beneficio, ‘thanks tom’: originally used with the gen. of
a person (esp. deorum). or such an adj. as luo, and then often with
the gen. of a thing, eg. patientiae (Epp. 119, 5), mortis (Dt'al. vi
20, 3): when the result is bad, uitio is used in the same wav with
the gen. .

8. rapacis ingenii, ‘a mind able to snatch learning⁷ z cf. Epp.
