232 AD HELVJAM

hoc adhuc defuerat tibi, ‘this thing only had not happened
to you before’ : i.e. there was only one thing wanting, ‘to complete
your experienee of sorrow: ef. De Beu. iii 15, 4 hoc unum deest
auaritiae, ut beneficia sine sponsore non demus: the phrase is
common in the tragedies of Sen.: cf. Herc. Fur. 836 derat lzoc solum
numero laborum3 Phoen. 7 derat aerumnis meis, Ι ut et* hostem
amarem 3 Phaedr. 1195 lzoc derat nefas, ut...; Troacl. 898 lzoc derat
unum Phrygibus euersis malum, Ι gaudere: Med. 1000 derat hoc
unum mihi, l spectator iste, differs in sense. The elder Seneca uses
iel deerat, ut... several times in a similar sense (Controu. i τι, 2 and
3, 1) : cf. Val. Max. ix 2, 2 id malorum miserm‘mae lunc reipublicae
deerat, ut Caesar caderet. So we speak of ‘the last straw‚' and the
French say, il ne mauquaz't plus que cela!

27. lugere 1111105, ‘ to mourn for the living as dead‚' exile being
as bad as death: for the meaning of lugere, cf. Polyb. 3 ἓ 5; Juv.
10, 2 57 Ithacum lugere natantem.

T his is tlte most grievous wound you have ever szffred. But, like
the vetet-an soldier z'n hospital, you are bound in honour to
submit with courage lo tlze surgeon's lmise. The cries and
[ears of most women are not for you, after all your experience
of sorrow. My mellzod (gf treatment llas placed all your past
griefs before you.

ξ 1. 28. grauissimum: to the modern reader it is remarkable
that Sen. takes for granted that his mother suffers more from her
son's exile than she did from her husband’s death. But the fact
that her husband had reached a great age, may have seemed to
make his death, as a natural event, no fit subject for sorrow.

29. descenderunt, ‘have gone deep’: cf. Epp. 40, 4 haec
oratio, quae sanandis mentibus adhibetur, descendere in nos debet.

30. nonznot merely.

uiscera, ‘the vital parts': uiscera has three meanings: (1) ‘the
flesh' )( the skin and bone: the commonest meaning; (2) ‘the
vital parts‚’ i.e. the heart, lungS, and liver3 (3) ‘the entrails':
the rarest meaning.
