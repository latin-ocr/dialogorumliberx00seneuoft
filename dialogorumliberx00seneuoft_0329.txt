NOTES (c. 10 ξ 3) 261

power is like a want of desire sor those things': cf. Epp. 67, ι’
(of the enforced temperance of old age) quicquid debebam nolle,
non possum, ‘where it is my duty to havevno desire, Ι have no
power.'

illa is awkward and superfluous3 Madv. substituted uellem but
the quotation shows that no inf„ neither uelle nor nolle, should
be supplied with potest. Possibly illa is due to some early reader,
who did not understand how the verbs could have no object.

1. ina, i.e. luxuries.

ξ 4. C. Caesar: here Caligula, but Julius Caesar 9 ἕ 6.

2. edidisse, ‘to have produced.'

ut ostenderet. ‘ that slze might show ⁷ τ rerum natm-a, not Caesar,
is shown to be the subject by similar passages z cf. Epp. 66, 1 [nique
se gessit natura, aut fortasse uoluit [κοί ipsum nobis ostendere, posse

Demez‘rius, quem mihi uidetur rerum natura nossrz's salissa tempori-
bus, ut ostenderet, nec illum α nobz's [orrnmpi posse cet.

3. fortuna, ‘ position‚' ‘ rank.'

centiens: this and similar adverbs are all niultiples os deciens,
which stands for deciens centena milia sesterlimn z therefore centiens
= 10,000,000 sesterces or J6100000.

sestertio, abl. of price, the contracted gen. plur. (sestertium) being
declined as a neuter noun.

4. in hoc, ‘ for this object.’

adiutus: concessive.

5. tributum is subject, cena predicate. The phrase is rhetorical;
sor the sum mentioned is too small for the yearly revenue from any
three Roman provinces: when Caesar organised Gaul as a province,
we are told that he fixed the poll tax (slepemlz'um) to be paid very
low ; yet it was 40‚000‚000 sesterces a year.

ξ 5. 6. palatum=appetite‚ sor which Latin has no precise
equivalent: Celsus uses cibi cupiditas, Juvenal (6, 427) uses araris,
and Aulus Gellius (xvi 3, 2) adpetitio: esna-ilio (used by Catullus and
Martial) is a painful sensation z for ⁶ want of appetite( fizsfz'dz'ltm is*
common and is used even of animals.
