Ι have tried to restore a satisfactory text by supposing
this form of mistake to have occurred.

The other manuscripts of the Dialogues are [ound in
many parts of Europe. (In the Cambridge libraries, how-
ever, Ι have found none, though of other treatises, eg. De
Clementia and De Beneficiis, there are a fair number.)
They are all inferior to A in age and goodness. Their
readings are generally denoted by the symbol 5‘. Every
one of them is interpolated, some more and some less :
that is to say, the honest blunders of A, from which it
is sometimes possible to recover the true text, have been
changed often beyond recognition by the perfidy of the
scribes, while they tried, without knowledge of the
language or attention to the context, to give an appear-
ance of Latin to what was not Latin at all. Thus,
where Seneca wrote agzmt opus suum fata (vi 21, 7),
the scribe of A misread the letters nt and wrote agurii
opus 5. f.: in the other mss. augurii was substituted‚
which is a Latin word but has no meaning here. Again
Seneca wrote: mortem„ qnae umus singultus opus est
(vi 11, 4). By the change of one letter in an unfamiliar
word, the scribe of A wrote ‘nnius singulius; but all
the other mss. have the ‘correction ' singulis, which
has led to further falsification and serves to make the
true reading hard 'to recover.

These are simple cases. Two instances will now be
given to illustrate the extent to which corruption,
starting from a very trifiing error in A, has spread in
various forms through all the other mss.
