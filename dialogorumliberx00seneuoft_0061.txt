WHO WAS MARCVS? liii

The whole poem is an asseveration 01 1116 1111111 01
501116 statement not here given. The first line shows
that Seneca came between his brothers in point 01 age.
In the second line, morte is probably equivalent to
exilio. The last two lines refer, as all allow, to the
Marcus of the treatise: his baby-talk is here compared
to the warbling of birds. It is the last line which is
decisive 01 1116 present question. When Seneca prays
that ‘ Marcus may rival with eloquent lips his two uncles ’
(which means ¹ may he rival their eloquence ’), the words
are appropriate, 11 they refer to Gallio and Seneca ;
they are not appropriate, if they refer to Gallio and Mela.
For Mela, owing 10 his choice of a profession, had nothing
to do with 3 sczcmzdmn OS ; it was the two elder brothers
of whom their father said 1 foroque se et honoribus parantl.
But, if Gallio and Seneca were the two uncles 01 Μ310115,
111611 Μ613 was his father, and the child himself can be
no other than the poet Lucan. ο

Had Lucan died in childhood, contrary to Seneca's
prayer, his family would have lost their chief pride and
joy ; but they might have escaped some of the horrors
which befell them. For Lucan, whose 31115110 vanity was
stung by Nero's attempt to suppress his genius, did, it
seems certain, join Piso's conspiracy ; and his guilt
dragged all 1116 1651, innocent or guilty, down in one
common ruin. Of the family, once so. powerful and
wealthy and distinguished, only one member survived
the year 66 ΑΒ. Τ1115 was Polla Argentaria, Lucan's
widow, who still revered his memory and kept his anni-
versaries at least twenty-seven years after his death2.
