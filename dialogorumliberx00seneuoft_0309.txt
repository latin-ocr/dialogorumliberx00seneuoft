NOTES (c. 6 ξ 2) 241

industria, ‘activity.'

7. laxam...materiam=an ample stage: cf. Polyb. 3 ἓ 2 ; Dz'al.
vii 22, ι quid dubii est, quin llaec maior materia sapienti uiro sit
animum explicandi suum, z'tz diuitiis quam in paupertate?

uirtuti, ⁶ their capacity.'

8. formam: these would be slaves, whose beauty fetched a
price in the Roman market.

ἓ 3. 10. magna pretia ponentem, ‘that offers high prizes’:
here again the pres. participle is doing the work of a relative clause:
see n. to destruentis, Polyb. 1 ἓ 1.

12. unde domo, ‘what is your domicile?’: cf. Virg. Aen. viii
1143 Hor. Epp. i 7, 53: the abl„ often used in inscriptions to
denote domicile (see Cagnat Epigraplzz'e p. 63), is probably an abl.
of origin, domo being in apposition with unde which is=a quo loco .?

maiorem partem, ‘more than half’ of the whole population:
this is surely incredible.

ἓ 4. 15. ciuitate, ‘ city.⁷

ueluti communis, ‘in a sense to belong to alls so that residence
at Rome is not expatriation for any man: so Pliny (Nat. Hz'st.
iii 39) describes Italy as a land chosen by Heaven, quae una
cunctarmn gentium in tolo orbe patria fieret.

17. multitudinis: gen. of definition: lit. ‘every city has a
large fraction (of its population) consisting osa foreign crowd⁷:
cf. 12 ξ 1 pars pauperum, ‘the fmction (of mankind) consisting
of the poor’; Polyb. 9 ξ 7 portus mortis.

18. ab iis: as transire regularly takes the acc., this constr. is
remarkable.

amoena refers, as usual, to natural beauty : but urbs pulcherrima
is made so by man.

19. plures=a specially large number.

asperrimaS, ⁴ rocky' : the islands, to which exiles were banished
—a system revived in the case of Napoleon and Garibaldi—
are often called scopuli: cf. Tac. Hz'st. i 2 plenum exiliis mare,
infecti caedibus scopuli ; Mart. ii 24, 4 per sivla, per scopulos exulis
ibo comes; Juv. 10, 170 ut Gyarz' clausus scopulis paruaque Seripho.

Sciathus, Seriphus, and Gyarus (or Gyara) are all small islands
in the Aegean.

20. Gossuran: Corsicam, the reading os the mss.‚ cannot be

right, because it anticipates the next point and spoils the climax.
D. s. 16
