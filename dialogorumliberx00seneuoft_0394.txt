Press Notices

“This work is a kind of encyclopaedia in minimo. ...The amount of
information gathered into seven hundred pages is a marvel....And,

strange to say, the book is quite pleasant to read in spite of its in-
numerable facts. The printing is admirable and the volume is well
illustrated....Mr Whibley is to be congratulated on his book. The
country can produce a body of scholars as caresul as the Germans...and

their judgment is notably sane.”—Guardian

“The scheme of the book is good. It is not a mere collection of
interesting miscellanea, but a clear and connected account of Greek life
and thought, written by scholars who are intimately acquainted with all
the latest developments of the subject....The mass of erudition that is
packed between its covers is astonishing....lt is thorough in the sense
that, in the majority of the articles, at least, the substance os our know-
ledge is given, the esseutial points are touched upon, and the theories of
first-rate ilnportance are concisely stated-’⁷—Salurday l=¹evi8w

“It is a handbook that no one will be ashamed to own and consult,
a handbook that will be sure to fill a place not only in libraries designed
sor the young, but also on the desk of the teacher, and on the shelves

of the scholar....It is a good book worthy of English scholarship.’'
sournal of Educatz'on

“The completeness of the scope is obvious. The excellence of the
work is guaranteed by the names of the contributors. The volume
should be on the Greek library shelves of every school where Greek is
seriously taught. Not for reference merely3 it will be read with avidity‚
apart from rask-work, by any boy that has the root of th'e matter in him.
The book is beautifully printed and produced.'⁷——Educat2'0nal Tt'mes

“This is an admirable book, in design and execution alike....The
choice of writers is above reproach....Secondly‚ the choice of matters is
good....Thirdly‚ the book is readable: it is not merely a work of refer-
ence. ...The pages are full os illustrations from art, li'ealz'en, inscriptions,
manuscripts; the printing is worthy of the Press; and the whole book
is good to look upon.”—Caml›ridge lx'eviev·
