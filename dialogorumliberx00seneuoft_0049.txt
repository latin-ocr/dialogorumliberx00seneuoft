GALLIO xli

(ii)
Gallio.

Three sons were born to Seneca and Helvia 1. Their
father, in the prefaces addressed to them, calls them
Novatus, Seneca, and Mela: the formula he uses runs
thus: Seneca Nouato, Senecae, Ilffelae filiis salmam. He
names them in the order 01 age. Elsewhere the eldest
son generally bears another name : at some date unknown
he was adopted by Lucius Junius Gallio, often mentioned
as an orator in his father's book ; and Gallio is the name
which he bears in Pliny the elder, Statius, Tacitus, and
other writers. Seneca dedicates his treatise On Awger
to him as Novatus but elsewhere speaks 01 him as Gallio.
It is a reasonable 11116161166 that the two works, in which
the name Novatus is used, were written before the
adoption.

There was plenty 01 money and no lack 01 brains
in the family; and both the elder sons adopted the
senatorial career2, with a view to the series 01 offices
which began with the quaestorship and culminated in
the consulship. Their father belonged to the inferior
rank 01 the aristocracy‚ the equites³; but they, like
Cicero in the same position, sought and gained admission
to the higher rank 01 senators. Gallio may have been
born about 6 B.C.‚ in which case he would be eligible 101

(i.e. equestri) contentus ordine. subdzccforlzrtnae magnam tuipartem
(withdraw to a large extent from the power 01 Fortune).
