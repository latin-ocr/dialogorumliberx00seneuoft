NOTES (e. 10 ᾗ 1) 259

8. tutelam: see n. to 9 ἓ 1.

ξ 2. 1 1. occupationes, ‘e11g1·osS111ents‚⁷ in the sense often found
in Dial. x (Paul.): his wealth only gave rise to business that was
engrossing and morally unprofitable.

12, 13. summoueri, extinguere: for this coupling of active
and pass. inf.‚ cf. ire and relinqui 9 ξ 43 Virg. Aen. iii 60 omnibus
idem animus, scelerata excedere terra, Ι linquz'pollulum hospilium εί
dare classibus austros.

12. frigus summoueri : cf. Lucan's description of Cato (ii 384):
lzuz’c epulae uicisse famem ; magnique penales, Ι summovisse hiemem
tecla.

13. quidquid-laboratur, ‘if we covet anything beyond, we
toil to serve, not our needs, but our vices.' For extra, Cicero
would use praelerea.

14. uitiis : dat.‚ common in Sen. for adand aec.: cf. Dz'al. viii
5, 1 natura nos ad utrumque genuz'l, cl ‹mzlcmplalz'oni rerum et
acli07zz‘3 Epp. 119, 15 ad salntem omnia parata sunl el in promptu,
deliciis omnia misere ac sollicite comparantur.

15. omne, ‘every'

perscrutari, ‘to ransack ⁷: cf. Epp. 89, 22 uos...quorum
profunda et insatiabilis gula lzz'nc maria scrutatur, hinc terras:
Juv. 5, 95 retibus adsiduis penitus scrutante macello Ι proxima.

16. conchylia, ‘shell-fish‚' especially oysters: Sen. probably
means oysters from Rutupiae (Richborough) in Kent: these were
much prized at Rome: it must have been difficult to get them fresh.

Oysters are one os the few eatables about which ancient and
modern opinion are atone: Pliny (Ναί. Hz'st. xxxii 59) says sar-
castically that he cannot write too much about ostrea, cum palma
mensarum (the first place in good eating) diu iam tribuatur illis.

17. ignoto is more than peregrino: thus it is used of China De
Ben. vii 9, 5.

18. inuidiosiztoo great for safety: lit. ‘exposed to z'nuz'dla‚’

⁰ because of its extent : cf. Epp. 87, 7 lantum suburbani agrz'possz'det,

quantum z'nuz‘diose in desertis Apuliae possideret.
imperii fines z if Sen. is, as I think, referring to British oysters‚
then this was written before the summer of 43 A.D.‚ when southern
England became a part of the Roman empire. See Introd. p. xxxii.
