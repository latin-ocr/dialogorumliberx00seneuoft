15. regis, ‘of a king ' here: for a different sense, cf. 3 ἓ 2.

17. missa est, ‘it was started’: the word is regularly used
os starting the ehariots in the Circus.

curret, ‘it will go on running.³

nusquam has two meanings here· Greek has two different
words to express them, οὐδαμοῖ and οὐδαμοῦ.

19. uelis nolis, ‘ willy-nilly ἐ common in Sen. ι cf. Apocol. 1,
2; Epp. 117, 43 Mart. viii 44, 16: for uelit nolit, cf. Sen. Dial.

Sen. Epp. 117, 4 : for uellet nollet, cf. Sen. Epp. 53, 3. The elder

The text of the first sentence is corrupt; Ι have printed an
emendation suggested to me by Professor Housman.

ἓ 1. 22. prudentiam iactant, ‘make a boast of their foresight,’
in getting ready beforehand z prudentia is often ‘ wisdom‚’ but that
sense does not suit this context.

occupati: see n. to 7 ξ 1.

23. inpendio uitae uitam instruunt, ‘they spend their life
in making provision for life': their object is to learn the right way
to live, before practising it. So thought Browning‘s Grammarian,
and was blamed by contemporary critics:

‘Others mistrust, and say “But time escapes:
Live now or never !”

He said ‘⁵ What’s time? Leave Now for dogs and apes!
Man has Forever.’⁷'

And surely, the philosophers, whom Sen. commends (c. 14), do
much the same as the Grammarian.
