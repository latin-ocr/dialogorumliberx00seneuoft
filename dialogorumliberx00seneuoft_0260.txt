The dilemma which follows is probably taken from Plato
Apol. 40 B δυοῖν ’γὰρ θάτερόν ἐστι τὸ τεθνάναι· ἣ ’γὰρ οἷον μηδὲν
εἶναι μηδ’ αἴσθησιν μηδεμίαν μηδενὸς ἔχειν τὸν τεθνεῶτα, ἢ κατά τὰ
λεγόμενα μεταβολή τις τυγχάνει οὖσα καὶ μετοίκησις τῇ ψυχῇ τοῦ
τόπου τοῦ ἐνθένδε εἰς ἄλλον τόπον; he proceeds to show that both
alternatives are desirable.

nam, like ’γάρ so used, is best omitted in English.

21. euasit omnia uitae incommoda: cf. Stat. Silu. ii 1, 220
ast lzic, quem gemimus, felix hominesque deosque l el dubios casus el
caecae lubrica uitae Ι effingit.

22. fuerat has the sense of erat : commoner in the poets : e.g.
Ovid Pont. iii 3, 37 uec satis id suerat ,· stulfus quoque furmina
feci.

nasceretur: nasus est would be used here in classical Latin,
as there is no idea of purpose: the irregular use begins with Livy
and is common in Sen.: cf. Dsal. vi 19, 5 mors nos in illam tran-
quillitatem, in qua antequam nasceremur jacuimus, reponit.

For the thought, cf. Lucr. iii 972 respire item quam nil ad nos
anteacta uetustas Ι temporis aeterni suerit, quam nascimur ante. Ι
