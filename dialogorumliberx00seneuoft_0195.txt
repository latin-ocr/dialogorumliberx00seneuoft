NOTES (c. 10 ξ 1) 127

It would be easy to prove sormally tlzat men make their lives slzorter
by the way in wlzz'cli tluy spond them ,· but suclz argument would
be misplaced. l'et attach on tlzefollies os men ›mcst be combined
with admom'tion.

Comparea’ to past time, present time is brief and insecure ; but no
man, unless lais mind is at ease and zmtroubled, can derive
pleasure from tlte recollectz'on of his past life.

ἓ 1. 5. quod proposui, ‘my theme.‘
in partes et argumenta diducere, ‘to divide into heads and
then prove them.' He does not do this, because Fabianus had

taught him that vice should not be argued with but put down
by force.

6. occurrent : cf. 20 ξ 3: but succurrit 3 § 4.

8. Fabianus had taught Sen.‚ who always speaks of him with
admiration ε the elder Seneca (Controu. ii praef. ξ Ι) says of him :
adulescens admodum, tantae opinionis (z famae) in declamando,
quantae postea in disputando (philosophical teaching) fuit.

his, ‘ of our day‚' is )( antiquis.

cathedrariis is )( ueris: cathedra is the professor's chair (J uv. 7,
203), and catlzedt'arii are philosophers who do not act as such
outside their lecture-room.

9. adfectus, τὰ πάθη, ‘ passions‚’ often called by Cicero animi
perturbationes: the Stoics distinguished sour os these—metus,
aegritudo, libido, and laetitia3 the two first are excited by what
men think to be evils, the two last by what 'they think to be
⁴ goods': see Cic. Tusc. Disp. iii ²4 : all are of the nature of sin,
but venial, compared to such morbi of the mind as auaritia and
ambitio: for an account of the difference between adfectus and
morbi, cf. Epp. 75, 11 foll.

10. suptilitate, ‘by chopping logic.’

minutis uolneribus, ‘ by pin-pricks.'

11. incursu, ‘ by a vigorous attaek.’

12. caumationem: a translation of σόφισμα introduced by
Cicero (sen. Epp. 111, 1): used by Sen. in two senses: (1) ‘strict
logical argument‚' not unfair but ineffective: so here and Epp. 108,
12 relictis ambiguitatibus et syllogismis et cauillationibus et ceteris
