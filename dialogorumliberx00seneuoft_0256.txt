188 AD POL YBIVM

ι.
12. Caesarem cogita: cf. Helu. 18 ἓ 9 patrem cogita: though

lzoc cogita is common, the use of a personal object is bold.

indulgentiae: this word soon became a technical term for
‘imperial favour,’ as may be seen in Pliny’s letters to Trajan. The
papal chancery, inheriting the word from the imperial court, made
it famous in a different sense.

13. fidem, ‘ loyalty.’

14. incuruari‚ ‘to bend under your burden' ε Sen. likes to use
this word in a metaphorical sense : cf. Dial. v 5, 8 non est magnus
animus, quem incuruat iniuriam Epp. 71, 26 succidere mentem et
incarnari et succzmzbere3 82, 113 104, ²43 Pers. 1, 91 me uolet
immutasse querella.

si quis modo est implies (cf. Dial. ii 2, 2) that the story of
Atlas is fabulous: cf. Lucan viii 159 iam pelago Titan medios de-
missus ad ignes Ι nec quibus abscondit, nec si quibus exserit, orbem, Ι
totus erat, where si conveys that the existence of the antzpodes is
disputed. ι

15. tradito: 50 1 read 101 tradims of mss. : the sense requires
this, as the story of Atlas, whether true or not, was certainly
traditional: sor the same kind of textual error, cf. Juv. 10, 253 cum
quaerit ab omni, 1 quisquis adest, socia, where P gives socius.

Bentley, in 1115 copy, inserted a comma after est but left traditus.

mu'nduS, ‘ the sky' : cf. Helu. 6 ξ 7.

17. uigilia, ‘watching,' in the sense of ‘ keeping awake ' : it 15
1101 11616 = m'gz'lantia.

ξ 2. 18. delicias, ‘indolence,’ has a shade of censure which
otium has not.

20. se caesar orbi terrarum dedicauit: for the ignominious
facts 01 1115 accession, cf. Suet. Claud. 10 : Sen. here is as ‘ poetical '
as Serjeant Buzfuz in his description os the decease 01 Μ1 Bardell.

sibi eripuit, ‘he has torn himself away from himself,’ i.e. he
has eut himself off from all selfish ohjects.

23· suum=for himself: this is true of the planets in the sense
that they have no power to vary their prescribed movements.

ξ 3. ad quendam...modum‚ ‘to a certain degree ' z not com-
pletely, for the servant must not aspire to equal his master.

24. utilitates, ‘ emoluments'3 studia, ‘booksss

26. impertire te, ‘give a share os yourself‚’ i.e. of your time.
