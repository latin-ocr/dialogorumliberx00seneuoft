NOTES(‹:.12§2) 135

5. iumentorum is a certain emendation for iunctorum of mss. ;
see n. to Helu. 11 ἕ 3.

Bentley, on the margin of his copy, suggested cirratorum or
cincz'nnatorum .

6. nouis cibis: the training diet of athletes was carefully
studied‚ and this patron of the ring was up-to-date in his methods.

ἓ 3. 7. quibus, ‘by whom ’z see n. to 11 ἕ 2.

aput tonsorem cet. t there is a similar scene in Juvenal (6, 487—
503), where a lady’s hair-dressing‚ at her own house, is described.
Martial (viii 52) speaks of a dandy who spent so long in being
shaved, that, before he was satisfied, the boy barber grew a beard.

9. in consilium itur, ‘solemn debate is held' ε cf. Juv. l.l. 497
est in consilio matmza. consilium (connected with consulere) is a
meeting for the purpose of deliberation ; concilium (connected with
conciliare) is a gathering in general.

ιο. deficiens, ‘where it is getting thin⁷1 cs. Suet. lul. 45
deficientem capillum reuocare (to comb forward) α uertice adsueuerat.

hinc atque illinc, ‘ from both sides.'

η. tamquam:‘as he might be, if...⁷: i.e. only an effeminate
customer could object.

13. excandescunt, ‘they flare up' 2 common in Sen., Petronius,
and Suetonius ε Cicero uses ἰνᾱ with it.

14. iuba. is a contemptuous term for part of the hair left to
grow long and sacred from the scissors.

ordinem: cf. Mart. iii 63, 3 bellus bomo est, flexos qui dzgrm}
ordine crines.

15. 1n anulos suos, ‘to form the proper ringlets⁷: suos refers
to omnia, not to the subject of etet-andenam. Cf. Mart. ii 66 unus
de tolo pacauerat orbe comarum Ι anulus, incerta non bene fixus
acu. It seems that part of the hair included in the iuba was curled.

16. rem publicam suam : editors have accepted a transposition
of suam, objecting, I suppose, to this phrase z but it occurs in Pliny
Epp. vii 15, 2 rei publicae suae negotia curare...laude dzgvissimum
est. There is a similar thought in Cic. Ad Ast. i 18, 6 (of the
optimates) ila sunt stulti, ut amissa re publica piscinas suas fore
saluas sperare uideantur.

turbari: the word can express disorder either in the state or of
the human hair: for the latter, cf. Mart. ii 36 flectere te nolim sed
nec turbare capillos (but I would not have you ruffle it either).
