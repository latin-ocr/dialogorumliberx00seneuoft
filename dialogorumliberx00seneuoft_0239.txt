NOTES 171

AD POLYBIVM
I

All tlte works of men’s lzancls must come to destruction in time.
Nay, we are told by some that the Universa ilself, with all
it contains, is doomed lo destruction. How tlzcn can an
individual complain tlzat lle and lzz's cannot escape the sentence
pronounced against all things?

Something more than the supplement printed in the text must
be lost here: the treatise cannot have begun so abruptly. But
it does not appear that much is lost. For most of the stock

arguments used in Consolationes (see Summers on Epp. 63) are duly
found here.

§L 2. compares, ‘one compares them’: the znd pers. of
the pres. subj. is often used in this sense: cf. Paul. 2 ἓ 1. The
following clause must begin with ‘but' in English.

redigas has the meaning of exigas, ‘ one considers them-⁷

ad, ‘ with reference to.'

condicionem, ‘the ordinance.'

3. destruentiszquae deslruere solet: see n. to rumpentibus
(Paul. 14 ξ 4) ε a use of the pres. participle unknown, at least in
the sing.‚ to classica] prose: it represents τῆς ὃιάιρούσης; but there
is no definite article in Latin, to make the meaning clear.

5. septem miracula: the usual list is : the walls of Babylon, the
temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the statue of Zeus at Olympia, the
Pyramids, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Colossus of Rhodes,
and the hanging gardens of Babylon: of these, the Pyramids alone
still make a stout resistance against time.

‘As the wonders of ancient days, the pyramids attracted the
curiosity of the ancients: an hundred generations, the leaves of
autumn, have dropt into the grave 3 and aster the fall of the Pharaohs
and Ptolemies, the Caesars and caliphs, the same pyramids stand
erect and unshaken above the floods of the Nile ' (Gibbon c. 71).
