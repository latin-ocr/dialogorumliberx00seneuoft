2. manus, ‘handling‚' i.e. surgery, constantly used of medici:
cf. Pliny quoted on 1 §2² the same use is seen in ‘surgeon‚’
formerly ‘chirurgeon' from χειρουργός.

3. ferrum, ‘the sword’ of the enemy.

quamuis confossi, ‘though their wounds are deep.⁷

4. uelut aliena corpora, ‘their bodies as if they belonged to
other people': cf. Thuc. i 70, 3 τοῖς σώμασιν ἀλλοτριωτάτοις ὑπὲρ
τῆς πόλεως χρῶνται.

exsaniari, ‘to be drained of matter⁷z the sanies (corrupted
blood) of their wound has to be removed : the meaning is different
in -Epp. 86, 6 multa suffitione cmpora exsaniata* (drained of
moisture).

For the contras-‚t between veterans and young soldiers, cf. Dial.
i 4, 7 ad suspicionem uulneris tiro pallescit, audacter ueteranus
cruorem suum spectat, qui scit se saepe uicisse post sanguinem (after
his blood has flowed).

6. curationi, ‘to treatment,' i.e. to the drastic means of con-
solation adopted by her son.

ξ 2. 7. per quae, ‘ by means of which.'

8. perdidisti tot, mala, ‘you have suffered so many sorrows to
no purpose': cf. Dial. v 23, 4 Timagenes..quaedam in iprum
dixerat, nec perdiderat (z frustra dixerat) dicta. This idiom, by
which perdere: pati frustra, dicere frustra, and many other verbs
so qualified, is found chiefly in Seneca and Lucan : cf. leyest. 1 101
perdideram (=fruslra admiserant) scelus, Ι nisi sic doleres3 Med.
984 uon in occulto tibi est Ι perdenda uirtus; Agant. 539 ignaua
fortes fata consument uiros? Ι perdenda (zsrurtra patienda) mors
est ,1⁹3 Lucan ii 440 quod non ipsum perdat (Ξ frustra saciat) iter3
iii 706 non perdere (z frustra pati) letum Ι maxima cura fuit3
x 370 quodficimus una Ι perdidimusque (=frustra fecimus) nefas.
The passive of perdere, i.e. perire, is also so used. We can hardly
use ‘waste' in this sense; but the Latin idiom was preserved by
the man who called out in a Dublin theatre‚ when an objectionable
person was being ejected from the galleiy: ‘Don't waste him,
boys! Kill a fiddler wid him !⁷

misera esse, ‘how to be wretched,·' i.e. how to bear
wretchedness.
