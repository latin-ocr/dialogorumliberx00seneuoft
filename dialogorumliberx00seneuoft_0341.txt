2. publice curari, ⁵ should be managed by the state*

3. fuitne : -ne has here the sense os nonne.

tantiza price worth paying: i.e. poverty‚ if it secured such
a great distinction, was worth it: for the different meanings of
tanti (a price worth paying, a prize worth getting), see n. to
JuV. 3, 54.

non habere, ‘to be without ⁷ ³ cf. Mart. ii 68, 8 sernum si poles,
Ole, non habere, Ι et rigent potes, Ole, non habere (if you can do with-
out a slave, you can do without a patron also).

colonus eius, ‘ his tenant,⁷ the tiller of his seven acme, which the
mercennarius tilled before his fraudulent disappearance.

Pliny also alludes to this anecdote of Regulus: A'al. Hz'sl. xviii
39 qui mortuo m'lico relinquere uictorias et reuerti z'n rura sua
postulabant ,· quorum heredia colenda suscipiebat res p„ exercitusque
ducebant, senatu illis uilz'canle (i.e. the senate acted as his uilicus

ξ 6. 4. Scipionis filiae: we know from Livy (xxxviii 57) that
the two daughters of Publius Scipio, who defeated Hannibal at
Zama 202 B.C.‚ were married to P. Cornelius Nasica and Ti.
Sempronius Gracchus, and that the first marriage at least took place
in Scipio's lifetime. Gnaeus Scipio, who fell in Spain 213 B.C., had
one daughter, for whom, [lut-ing lzis lifi’time, the senate provided a
dowry (Val. Max. iv 4, 10). Sen. either made a mistake‚ or mis-
stated the facts, for the sake of his epigram about Carthage.

antithesis here: Scipioni is )( a Karthagine, smel to semper, con-
firre to eng-eret.
