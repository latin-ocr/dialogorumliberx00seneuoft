NOTES (c. 4 ξ 4) 107

florentissima, nos duriore conflictati uidemur (where out of conflictati
must be supplied a verb with the opposite meaning).

12. hominibus, ‘individuals‚’ is )( gentibus.

13. fortunam dabat, ‘made happy or unhappy‚⁷s0rtzma having
two meanings: comp. il faisait la pluie et le heau temps ὰ toul le
monde.

illum diem, ‘that future day’: the words can mean ‘that past
day,' when the context requires it.

1 4. exueret = exuturus esset.

16. exprimerent is used in its primary sense of wringing
moisture from something wet, as a sponge or eloth.

ἕ 5. 17. ciuibus, ‘his count1·ymen,⁷ in the civil wars, at Mutina
(43 B.C.) and Philippi (μ. B.C.).

18. collegis should mean the other two triumvirs‚ Lepidus and
Antony3 but Sen. evidently refers to the battle of Naulochus
(36 B.C.) against Sextus Pompeius: it is true that the deposition of
Lepidus was a consequence of this battle.

adfinibus (plur. sor symmetry) refers to Antony, the husband
of Octavia the sister of Augustus: he was defeated at Actium
(31 B.C.).

20. Aegyptum, Syriam Asiamque: the historical order is not
observed. Augustus went to Asia and Syria in 31——30 B.C. after the
battle of Actium; but he did no fighting there, and his settlement
was made by diplomacy, not by arms. From Syria he went to
Egypt (30 B.C.)‚ where he occupied Alexandria with little trouble
and made Egypt into a province (Suet. Aug. 17 and 18).

21. oraS‚ ‘countries.’ The language is somewhat exaggerated :
it would be truer of Julius Caesar: cf. Helu. 9 ξ 8.

²3· Alpes pacat: Augustus waged many wars, but not in
person, against the Alpine peoples: these came to an end in 8 ss.C.‚
when the province os Raetia was ‘formed; at the same time a trophy
was erected, and the site named Tropaea Augusti, now Torbla near
Monaco.

immixtos...hostes apparently refers to the Ligures and other
Alpine tribes, who held out long after Spain and Gaul had yielded
to Rome. Or Sen. may refer to the Dalmatians: they and the
Cantabri, not mentioned here, were the only foreign foes against
whom Augustus fought in person.
