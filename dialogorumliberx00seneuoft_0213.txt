NOTES (e. 13 ξ 6) 145

18. commissis...noxiis hominibus, ‘criminals being pitted
against them.' Sen. seems to err here, as Pliny (ΛΖ.) says that
African javelin-throwers were brought over to fight the elephants.

20. princeps ciuitatis: cf. Dial. vi 20, 4 (of Pompey) indubi-
tatus populiRomanz'princeps: Cicero (Post Red. in Seu. 4) denotes
Pompey thus without naming him z it is not a formal title.

antiquos z of that time: P. is, Ι think, compared mainly with his
contemporaries, especially Caesar and Crassus3 but perhaps Marius
and Sulla may be included.

21. bonitatis, ‘kindness of heart’: the sense survives in the
French bonte'. It is Pompey's chief distinction, that he showed
unexampled humanity in dealing with foreigners and captives, e.g.
the Cilician pirates 2 in this respect, Caesar takes a second place.

22. homines, ‘human beings‚' is emphatic.

depugnant, ‘ are they to fight to the death ?’ : Pompey is repre-
sented as debating in his own mind the fate of these men.

23. lancinantur: lancinare is said of animals which kill with
teeth and claws‚ e.g. lions or panthers.

ingenti mole animalium, ‘by animals of monstrous size’: cf.
Pliny Nat. Hz'st. viii 3 (of elephants) el illas moles infestant morbi
(even these monsters suffer from diseases).

24. exterantur: cf. Epp. 57, 7 animam hominis magno pondere
extrt'tz'3 Pliny Nat. Hz'st. xviii 298 messis alibi equarum gressibus
exteritur, alibi perticis (flails) flagellatur.

§ ’1. 25. inuideret z should wish to imitate.

1. sub alio caelo natis: but, if Pliny is right, the elephants and
their slayers both carne from Africa. This is perhaps imitated by
Juv. 12, 103 ηει- Latio aut usquam sub nostro sidere talis Ι belua
concipitur.

3. conspectu: A reads conspectum: but the use of conspectus
in the sense of spectaculum appears to be unexampled.

4. mox: i.e. at Pharsalia, Aug. 9, 48 ΒΕ.

5. perfidia: the advisers of king Ptolemy invited P. to leave
his ship and enter Alexandria; on his way to the shore he was
murdered in the boat.
