152 AD PA VLJNVM

professores eius ut antistites colile3 Pliny Nat. Hist. vii 110 Platoni
sapientiae antistiti.

6. adire, inserted by Thomas after artium, improves the style:
but it may be a correction of the author.

7. nemo horum non uacabit, ‘none of these will be “Not
at Home ”·': cf. 2 §5 See Macaulay quoted in Introd. p. xix.
Sen. regards the dead authors as being visited; Macaulay, as visitors3
and Macaulay would not have been pleased if his visitors had all
been philosophers.

8. uenientem=rbv φοιτῶντα; see n. to Polyb. 1 ξ 1.

9. amantiorem sui is ambiguous z sm' may refer (1) to the sub-
ject of dimittet and, in view of ad se above, this seems more likely; or
it may refer (2) to the visitor, who gets peace of mind from the philo-
sopher: cf. Hor. ΕΜ. i 18 101 qnid te tibi reddat amicum: it is
characteristic of the occupatus that he displicet sibi: cf. 2 ἓ 2 3 Dz'al.
ix 2, 10 hinc illud est taedium et displicentia sui.

10. conueniri, ‘ to be interviewed.’

Such intercourse with the mighty dead involves no danger and
no expense. They will give you all you ask their campanian-
ship will ensure the happiness os your old age. You can choose
sor yourself: whatever company ofphilosophers you care'to enter,
they will welcome you. The writings of the ‚fages outlz've all the
works of men’s hands ; their same grows with time. ln this
way the Wz‘se hlan enjoys all time, past and ficture no less
than present.

ξ 1. 12. omnes docebunt, ‘but all will teach you,’ how to die :
the first part of this sentence was written for the sake ofthe second :
a Roman grandee could not force his clients to die; an emperor
might, as Sen. was to learn by personal experience.

15. conteret: cf. Mart. iv 8 prima salutantes atque altera
conterit (continet some mss„ but this passage supports conterit) hora:
both writers refer to the bodily wear-and-tear osa elient’s lise.

contribuet: the subject is quisque to be supplied out of nemo:
cf. Cic. Ad Att. vii ²5 nemo huc ita adfert omniaque quae nolim
(nobody brings news here to that effect‚ and everyboa’y brings only
unwelcome news).
