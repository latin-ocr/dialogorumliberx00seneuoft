256 AD HEL ΝΛΜ

prouocatus gratissimo milei libro, quem ad me ‘de m'rlule' misisti
(you dedicated to me) : another philosophical work by Brutus ‘ Con-
eerning Duty‚' περὶ καθήκοντος, is mentioned by Sen. Epp. 95, 45;
and a third, De Patientia, is elsewhere recorded.

Marcellum: M. Claudius Marcellus, consul in 51 B.C.‚ was a
strong partisan of the senate in their breach with Caesar. In
Lucan (i 313) he is called by Caesar loquax, ‘the man of words' ;
and he certainly took little part in the war. After Pharsalia he
retired to Mytilene and devoted himself to study ;· when allowed
by Caesar to return to Italy, he was murdered in Athens on his
way home (46 B.C.).

28. hominis z humana.

pateretur, ‘permsts’z Latin idiom retains the time of uidisse,
but it is unnatural in English : ef. ἓ 7 scires.

²9· bonarum artium, i.e. rhetoric and philosophy: cf. 17 § 3.
Marcellus studied oratory at Mytilene and attended the lectures of
Cratippus, a Peripatetic philosopher, who afterwards was the teacher
of Cicero's son at Athens (Cic. Brutus ²50)-

2. rediturus, ⁶ about to return to Rome ⁹ : Brutus fought against
Caesar at Pharsalia, but got his pardon before Marcellus did.

ἕ 5. 5. rei publicae consulatum, sc. adprobam't: this is a
flourish of rhetoric ε Cicero himself, a strong partisan of the senate,
expresses disgust with Marcellus, when, as consul, he flogged an
ex-magistrate of Novum Comum, a colony founded by Caesar (Cic.
Ad Att. v 11, 2 Marcellus sbede in Comensi).

8. Catoni suo: cf. Polyb. 15 ἐξ, Drusi sui: Brutus was the
son-in-law of Cato, and, if we may trust Lucan, considered him an
infallible guide in politics as in other matters. To Sen. himself,
Cato was what a canonised saint is to a devout Catholic.

ἓ 6. 10. praeteruectum‚ ‘had sailed past' without landing
there: probably in August 47 B.C.‚ after the campaign against
Pharnaces.

deformatum uirum, ‘a great man ma1·red‚' i.e. Marcellus, aster
he had lost the trappings of greatness: cf. Cic. Mur. 88 imaginem
deformatam rgnomz'nz'a3 Sallust lug. 14 ἓ 7 clefhrmatus aerumnis.

1 1. quidem does not qualify illi, but the whole clause.
