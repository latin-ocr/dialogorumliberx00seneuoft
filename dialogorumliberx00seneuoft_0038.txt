there is considerable learning in this book. He wrote
. also in Greek an Etruscan History in twenty volumes,
and a Carthaginian History in eight1.' In some of these
works Claudius may have availed himself of the assis-
tance of Polybius ; but the result of their joint labours
is all lost to us.

The second office which Polybius held, that of a
libellis, was even more laborious than Seneca’s language
would suggest. He speaks2 of the huge mass of docu-
ments, which it was the duty of Polybius to put in order
and bring before the notice of the emperor, as is they were
all petitions for pardon.

No doubt, there were many of these·¹ Seneca⁷s own
treatise, though it calls itself a Condolence, is really a
disguised libellus of this kind—a prayer to be recalled
from exile. And I suspect that this, more than any
persona] tie between them, is the reason why it was
addressed to Polybius rather than to officials of even
greater influence, such as Pallas or Narcissus. It found
its way, in the ordinary course of business, to Polybius
and the petition-office.

But libelli were presented to the emperor for many
other purposes. Thus Juvenal advises the active
youth to send in a libellus, asking for the rank of cen-
turion³ ; and Pliny, in his correspondence with Trajan,
speaks often of libelli which he is forwarding with his own
letter, and these are very miscellaneous in character.
One is a denunciation (hence our word ‘libel ¹), and
the party denounced also sends in his libellus ; ano‘ther
is a request from the people of Amisus for leave to form
a benefit-club; a third is a request from a centurion
