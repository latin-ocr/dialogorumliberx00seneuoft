170 AD ΡΑ VLJNVM

mouent, quae maiorem annis LX otio reddunt (the numeral is ap-
parently due to conjecture, but some numeral is required).

ἕ 5. 7. fructu, ‘enjoyment' (not ‘result ³).

profectu animi, ζ moral improvement-³

profectus means ‘ advance‚' ⁴ improvement? and is often used eg.
by Quintilian of rhetorical students: but Sen. uses proficere and
professus to represent προκόπτειν and προκοπή, technical terms with
the Stoics for advance towards the ideal represented by the sapiens:
cf. Epp. 75, 8 qui proficit, iu numero quidem stultorum est, magno
lamen interuallo ab illis diducitur. (He then divides proficientes
into three classes, according to their degree of progress.)

8. in conspicuo habet, ‘ keeps in view’ z a phrase hardly found
out of Val. Maximus.

9. intendit : extendit (9 ἓ 1) would seem more suitable.

11. operum publicorum, munera: cf. Pliny Epp. vi 34 recte
feristi, quod gladz'alorium munus Veronensibus promisisti. inde
uxorem habuisti, cuim memoriae aut opus (public building) aliquod
aut spectaculum debebatur.

munera, ‘shows of gladiators⁷: the word suggests the original
object of these shows: it was to honour the dead at their burial.

12. ambitiosas, ‘pompous‚⁷ ‘pretentious’2 cf. 15 ἕ 4 and
Petron. c. 78 ego gloriosus uolo efferri, ut totus mz‘lzz' populus bene
imprecetur. Tacitus says of the ancient Gerrnans (Germ. 27)·
funerum nulla ambitz'o; but their descendants have paid heavily
to Mr Mould for ‘long-tailed prancers, never harnessed under ten
pund ten ' (Mat-tin Clutzzlewit c⁴ 19).

13. ad. faces et cereos: children were buried at night by
torchlight: cf. Dz'al. ix 11, 7 totiens praefer limen inmaturus
exsequias fax cereusque praecessi& Epp. 122, 10 (of men who turn
night into day) quantulum a funere absunt, et quidem acerbo, qui
adjaces et cereos uiuunt!
