in his disturbed province. It is possible that the Paul-
inus addressed by Seneca is the same man. For, though
the praefectura annonae was one of the great offices
regularly held by equites, there are instances in which
senators were, for special reasons, selected to fill one
or other of the praefecturae equestres1; or it may be
that Paulinus, being an eques, was created a senator by
imperial nomination (adlectio). The language used by
Seneca² shows that Paulinus was still in the prime of life
about 50 A.D. ; so it is not surprising that he should be
actively employed in important posts twelve years later.

Is the Paulinus of Seneca is also the Paulinus of
Tacitus, it is clear that he did not follow the advice
given him, to retire from official life. But it is possible,
as we shall see, that Seneca did not in the least expect
that his advice would be taken.

The Date of the Dialogue.

In most cases it is impossible to fix, even approxi-
mately‚ the dates of Seneca's dialogues; and this is
true also of his letters. Much has been written on the
subject, with little result: Madvig’s words remain as true
as when they were written: librorum Senecae praeter
paucos temp0ra incerta sunt (Adu. Crit. ii 344).

The ‘ descriptions of place, notifications of time, and
peculiarity of circumstances,’ which Bentley found in the
letters of Cicero and missed in Phalaris, are nearly as much

the office of praefectus praetorio.
