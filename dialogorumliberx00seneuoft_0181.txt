NOTES (c.6§1) 113

27. stipatus, ‘ supported and surrounded’ ἰ this word has often
(not always, cf. Polyb. 3 ἓ 4) an invidious sense. The Italians were
eager for the franchise, and Drusus was favourable to their claims 3
this alliance, being odious to the senate, proved his ruin; and his
death was the direct occasion of the Social War (90—89 B.C.).

28. exitum rerum, ‘a successful issue to his policy.’

page 8

1. agere, ‘to go on with,' seems weak, where one would expect
adfinem agere: but ef. mouet (zamouet) 15 ἓ 4.

3. dicitur dixisse sounds bald to us; but the Roman ear was
less sensitive to near repetitions of the same word: a number of
parallels (to which add Livy ix 7, 2) are quoted by Reid on Cic.
Pro Archia p. 86.

5. pupinus: cf. Helu. 18 ξ 7: he must have lost his father
in early youth3 the fact is not known from any other source.

adhuc: see n. to 5 ξ 2.

praetextatus: cf. Epp. 4, 2 tenes memoria, quantum senseris
gaudium, cum praetexta posita sumpsisti uirilem togam el in sin-nm
deductus es: to plead in the courts before this formal iutroduction
took place, was evidently most exceptional: Quintilian speaks of
such cases, as if he hardly believed them : xii 6, 1 cum praetextatos
egisse (have spoken) quosdam sit traditum.

reos commendare : it was commoner for young nobles to begin
public life (tirocinium ponere is the phrase) by prosecuting some
criminal : cf. Quint. xii 7, 3 crediti sunt ctiam clari iuuenes obsidem
reipublicae dare malorum ciuium accusationem : he then quotes as
instances‚ Hortensius, the Luculli, Sulpicius, Cicero, Caesar, and
both Catos.

6. foro, ‘ the law-courts.'

7. iudicia raptazreos ereptos: cf. Quint. vi 5, 10 (of Cicero) nt
Cornelium eripuerit: the verb implies that the verdicts were in the
teeth of the evidence z no details are known.

ἕ 2. 8. quo non erumperet, ‘to what lengths was not...likely to
go?' erumperet has the sense of eruptura erat: his turbulent
beginnings made future excesses certain.

9. scires, ‘one could have told': cf. Ovid illel. i 162 scires
e sanguine natos.
