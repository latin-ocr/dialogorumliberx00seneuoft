xxiv [NTRODUCTJON

the good word of Polybius might have been effectual.
But the treatise, whether it failed or sueceeded in con—
soling Polybius for the loss of his brother, certainly
failed in bringing about the recall of Seneca. He re-
mained in Corsica until Messalina had followed Polybius
to the grave ; and it was not till 49 A.D. that Agrippina,
the successor of Messalina as consort of Claudius, recalled
Seneca to superintend the education of Nero, then a boy
of twelve. There is truth in what Seneca is made to

say in the Octauia, a play which was probably written
not long after Nero's death:

melius latebam procul ab inuidiae malis
remotus, inter Corsici rupes maris,

ubi liber animus et sm‘ iuris milti
semper uacabat, studia recolenti meal.

He would indeed have been a happier man, if he had
never left the rocks of Corsica.

The Date of the Dialogue.

The treatise was written during Seneca’s exile, i.e. at
some date between 41 and 49 A.D. A phrase near the
end² implies that Seneca had been a long time in
Corsica before he wrote it ; but not much stress can be

in heaven orders a culprit to execution : putares omnes illius
esse libertos: adeo illum nemo curabat.

1 Ll. 392 foll. The play comes down to us as Seneca's
but was not written by him: it describes Nero's end, which
Seneca did not live to see. The play is interesting, and
the fate of the heroine pathetic : the style is quite worthy of
the age of Seneca.
