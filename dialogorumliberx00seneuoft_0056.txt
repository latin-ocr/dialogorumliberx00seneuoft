without warning 110111 0116 point to another; in these
respects his inferiority to such a master as Cicero is
unrnistakable. His level 01 style is singularly even:
in lampoon or letters, treatises 01 tragedies, there is
the same flow 01 ideas, the same cleverness 01 execution.
The Natural szzestzssoaszs, the work 01 1115 old age, alone
bears obvious marks of iailing powers. In later times

seen and even spoken with Seneca. He had stood before
great men already in his time. But these fourteen
letters, eight 110111 Seneca and six 110111 Paul, could not
possibly have been written by the persons 10 whom they
are attributed. They contain ludicrous absurdities. In
the seventh letter, Seneca expresses the pleasure with
which he has read Paul’s epistles 10 1116 (3313113115,

that Paul carne to Rome in February 58 A.D., was released
after two years, and eventually suffered martyrdom at Rome
