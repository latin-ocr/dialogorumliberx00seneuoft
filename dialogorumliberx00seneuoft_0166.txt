98 AD ΡΑ VLJNVM

is often ‘caught in the act,’ but also means ‘taken unawares': cs.
Mart. vi 64, 3 peperit deprensa sub ilice coniunx.

maximum poetarum generally means either Homer or Virgi1;
but there is no such passage in either. Sen. refers, either to a
fragment of Menander (Kock 111 p. 120) μικρόν τι τὸ βίου’καὶ στενὸν
ζῶμεν χρόνον, or, more probably (for the meaning in Menander is
clearly not the same as here), to a lost line of a tragic poet, perhaps
Euripides. To make a verse, Gertz alters the text thus: extgrua
uitae pars ea est qua uiuimus.

27. more oraculi, i.e. with the iinpressiveness of an oracle:
cf. Polyb. 14 ἓ 2.

uerum esse, for quin uerum sit: the constr. is common in Livy
and later writers, after non dubitare: cf. Helu. 1 ἓ 1.

28. uiuimuszwe really live: cf. 3 §5

29. cetcrum: adj., not adverb.

quidem should be noted. In Latin generally qm'demznkv,
e.g. Mart. i 108, 2 pnlslzmz quidem uerum Transtiberina domus; but
Seu. osten uses it as here to introduce the second of two opposed
clauses, so that it appears to have the sense of 643 really, the second
clause is asyndetic‚ and quidem, like γε, einphasises the word which
it follows: cf. 8 §1; Helu. 11 §73 De Clem. i 21, 1 regem et
seruus occidit et serjwns et sagitla .· serualn't quidem nemo nisi maior
eo quem seruauit. Others have this use, but much more rarely:
eg. Cic. Tusa. Disp. i 67 haec magna, haec diuina, haef sempiterna
sunt‚· qua sarie quidem (²7⁶) sit aut ubi habitet (the soul)⁷ ne
quaerendum quidem est.

tempus, ‘merely time.'

ἓ 3. 1. circumstant: sor the position, cf. Polyb. 6 ἓ 1.

2. dispectum ueri, ‘the discerninent of truth’: the word im-
plies that it is hard to discern.

sinunt: the object understood is mankind in general.

3. premunt, ‘keep them down.’

4. ad se, i.e. to their true selves. The image seems to be from
a culprss, whose head and legs are fixed in stocks.

6. post uentum quoque, ⁶ even when the storin is over’:
quoque constantly has the sense os eliam in silvei· Latin.
