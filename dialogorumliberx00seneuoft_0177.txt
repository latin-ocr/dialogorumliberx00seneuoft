NOTES (c, 4 ᾖ 6) 109

tot nobiles iuuenes: five of Julia's lovers are named by
Vell. Pat. ii 100. Tacitus (Ann- iii 24) says that Augustus
punished her lovers as guilty of treason, maiestas; Pliny (Nat. Hz'st.
vii 149) speaks of adulterium filiae et consilia parricidae palam facta.

adulterio uelut sacramento adacti, ‘enlisted in her service by
her guilty favours ’: i.e. as her lovers, they were virtually sworn to
fight for her, even against her father.

²9· iam—territabant, ‘ often alarmed him, when he had become
old and feeble.⁷

1. Paulus: L. Aemilius Paulus was the husband of the younger
Julia, grand-daughter of Augustu53 he lost his life, at a date
unknown, for a conspiracy against the emperor. ⁸

timenda cum Antonio mulier is all one phrase qualified by
iterum. Antonio, ‘an Antony.’

In 31 B.C. Augustus had to fight Mark Antony and Cleopatra;
in 2 B.C. his enemies were Iullus Antonius, son of the triumvir, and
his pararnour, the elder Julia. Julia was banished, Iullus was
put to death: cf. Tac. Ann. iv 44, 5 lulo Antonio ob adulterium
Iuliae morte punito.

This Antony, ason of Fulvia adopted by bis stepmother Octavia,
was consul 10 B.C. Some mss· of Horace in the Ode addressed to
him (iv 2), and inscriptions, show that his name was Iullus, and
the verse shows that it is a dissyllable: the name is Gaulish: why
he got it, is not known : it is often misspelt in mss. as sulus or lulius.

2. haec ulcera are the two Julias: Sen. imitates the words οί
Augustus himself: cf. Suet. Aug. 65 nec aliter eos (the two Julias
and Agrippa, his grandson) appellare solebat quam tres uomicas a
tria carcinomata sua (sores and cancers).

cum ipsis membris, ‘limbs and all’: the two women seem to be
identified both with the ulcera and the membra. The meaning is,
that they were banished. > The younger Julia died on an island off
Apulia in 28 A.D.‚ after 20 years of exile. Ovid also was banished
in 8 A.D., and it has been surmised that his fate was connected with
hers.

3. uelut cet. : the metaphor from disease now becomes a simile :
as the body, in a certain state of disease, is liable to intermittent
