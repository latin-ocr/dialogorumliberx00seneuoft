what strangely were, sor the Arian heresy, he persecuted
the orthodox believers among his subjects; and about
480 A.D., in the course of this persecution, forty-six
catholic bishops were banished to Corsica, to cut timber

Seneca: ‘he hath also vented his spleen against the
place of his exile, in the same extravagant manner,
in his books De Consolatione. But we must consider
that, notwithstanding all the boasted firmness of Seneca,
