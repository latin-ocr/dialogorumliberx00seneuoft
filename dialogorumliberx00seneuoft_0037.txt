JMPERA TOR HISTORICVS xxix

divine poem of the Capitoline War beside the mighty
work of tragic Virgil¹.'

The ¹ divine poem ¹ was Domitian's own epic on the
¹ fighting at Rome in 68 A.D.; and it is probable that
Sextus not only watched its birth but had a share in
the paternity.

Domitian’s authorship was a sham ; but under
Claudius this office can have been no sinecure. For,
with all his weaknesses, intellectual as well as moral,
Claudius was a man of genuine learning and a prolific

author. ¹ He began to write history as a young man,
encouraged by Livy and in collaboration with Sulpicius
Flavus.. . .During his reign also he wrote a great deal,

which he caused to be read to an audicnce.· His history
began with Caesar's death. He then skipped a period
and began at a later point, i.e. the end of the civil wars.
Of the earlier time he found it impossible to write
frankly and fully : he was so much taken to task by his
mother and grandmother' (Antonia and Livia). ‘On
the first period he wrote two voluines, on the second,
forty-one. He wrote also eight volumes of „Uenzoirs with
more literary skill than regard sor his dignity; also
A Defence os Cicero, in reply to a work by Asinius Gallus ;

¹ Mart. v 5:

Sexte, Palatinae cultor facunde Mineruae,
ingenio frueris qui propiore dei: ¹
nam tibi nascentes domini cognoscere curas
et secreta ducis pectora nosse licet:
sit locus et nostris aliqua tibi parte libellis,
qua Pedo, qua Marsus, quaque Catullus erit.
ad Capitolini caelestia carmina belli
grande cothurnati pone Maronis opus.

For Domitian's poem, cf. Quint. x 1, 91 and 92 quis enirn
caneret bella melius quarn qui sic gerit? (where the context
proves that the poem was an epie).
