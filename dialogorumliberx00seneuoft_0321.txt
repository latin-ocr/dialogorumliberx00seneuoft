[f tlze soil os Corsica produces nothing valuable, tlze sky can be seen
from tlzere as well as from ather places. A ll tlte buildings of
tlte wealthy and luxurians only serve lo hide tlte sky from them.
T lze best lzozcse in Corsica is no more thau a cottczge ; but a
cottage in wlzz'clz Vz'rtue dwells is better llum any palace- b‘ern
Marcellus was in eaz'le al Mytilene, Brutus found it Ιιανιί lo
leave lzim ,¹ and Caesar, wlzo had driven lzim iulo exile, was
ashamed to visit him. Yon may be sure that lllaroellus com-
pared lzis lise to Caesar’s, and preferred tlte admiration qf
Brutus to tlze power of Caesar, driven by civil war to every
quarter of tlze world.

ξ 1. 1. ab: an imaginary opponent of the argument points out
the defects of Corsica.

laetarum: the epithet, common of segetes and pabula, is less
common of trees: but cf. Dial. vi 16, 7 adolessunt amissis laetiora
(more flourishing shoots) 3 Aulus Gellius xii 1, 16 arborem laetam el
nitentem; Lucr. v 9²1 herbarum genera ac fruges arbustaque
laela3 Pliny (Nat. Hist. xvii 10) says that the N. wind makes
trees densiores laetioresque3 Martial (ix 61, 16) speaks of laetior
umbra of a plane-tree. As laetae arbores are here )( frugiferae, they
seem to be trees ‘with rich foliage,’ grown for shade. In point of
fact, it appears that trees grew well in Corsica : see Introd. p. xxxv.

4. tutelam, ‘supp01·t‚² ‘sustenance’z cf. Suet. lul. 68 cum
lenuzbrum tutelam locupletiores in se contulissent. v

5. lapis, ‘marble⁷: sor caeditur, cf. Mart. vi 42, 12 certant
uario decore saxa, Ι quae Phryx et Libys altius cecidit.

§2 6. angustus, ‘petty,' ‘limited.'

7. illa, i.e. caelestia. Gold and silver, in their natural state,
are hidden and have no lustre.

8. et hoc cogitandum est, ‘there is another thing to bear
in mind ἐ i.e. the terrena are not only inferior in themselves, but
also hinder their possessor in the enjoyment of caelestia.

9. per, ‘ by means of' : falsa and praue credita are epithets of
bona understood.
