Nat. His-t. xxxvi 119 luzm‘s'riurbes terrae lcz'atz'bus publicus mortalium
dolor est.

ut opinantur goes with malo: it is not really an evil.

malo: for the dat.‚ cf. 20 b 23 Helu. 16 ξ 5.

7. imprudens:z'mperz'tmu, the common epithet of the vulgar
herd: impudens (the reading of A) is strange in itself and does not
give a good contrast with clarorum below.

8. adfectus, ‘feeling' : cf. 17 ἕ 1 : Cic. would use acffectio
animi here. acffittus has two other senses in Sem: (Ι) ‘passion'
e.g. hope or sear: see 11. to 10§ 1; (2) ‘affection'z cf. Helu. 18 ἓ 9.

9. maximi medicorum: Hippocrates of Cos, b. 460 B.C.:
described by Sen. in the same terms Epp. 95, 20, by Pliny (Nat.
Hist. vii 171) as princeps medicinae, by Quintilian (iii 6, 64) as
[lmus arte medicinae. Sen. refers to the famous first Aphorism os
Hippom·ate8‚ ὁ βίος βραχὺς ὴ δὲ τέχνη μακρή.

§a 10. Aristotelis: Sem, often inaccurate in matters of detail,
gives the wrong name by a slip of memory: cf. Cic. Tucc. Dz'sp. iii 69
Theophrastus moriens accusasse naturam dicitur, quod cernis et
cornicibus uitam diuturnam, quorum id nz‘ln'l interesset, hominibus,
quorum maxime iutmszusset, tam exiguam uitam dedisset.

1 1. exigentis: the constiuction is awkward, because cum ν. n.
has to be taken both with engrentjs and with lis (sc. est). For exlgere
cum, ‘to expostulate with‚⁷ cf. Epp. 27, 1 mecum exige ; Pliny Epp.
vi 12, 3 cum εἰς· exegeris mecum ut solebas cum tuo filio.

(As precz'sely these two passages me quoted llere? by Gertz, l tlzink
it mgrlzt to say tluzl l do not owe them to him .· my nole was printed
as it stands, bey‘bre l had scen llis edition. T lle same z's true of the
quotation to p. 15, l. 18, and osllze explanatious given oss. 51, l. 18;
p. 65, l. 9; p. 85, l. 15.)

12. lis, ‘grievance³: see n. to 3 ἓ 2.

¹3· saecula, ‘life-ti1nes,’ i.e. periods of human life: the dis-
tributives are used, because eaclz animal has a separate allowance.

According to Hesiod, the raven lives nine times as long as a Ἴ
man, the stag four times as long as the raven: ef. Pliny Nat. Hisl.
vii 153 Hesiodus cornici nouem nostras attribuit aetates, quadruplum
eius cernis, id triplicatum corais, et reliqua fabulosius in phoenice ac
Nymphis. See Mayor on Juv. 10, 247.
