NOTES (c. 2 ξ 3) 99

uolutatio, ‘a swell': cf. Herc. Fur. 1095 sed ut ingenti uexata
Noto 1 seruat longos luzda tumultus Ι et, iam uento cessante, tumet.

fluctuantur: the deponent form seems confined to silver Latin:
Quintilian (ix 3, 7) recognises both forms: pleraque utroque modo
ffruntur (many verbs are conjugated in both voices) .· luxuriatur,
luxuriat ,· fluctuatur, fluctuat.

7. stat=t<a06¹ffrnxe‚ ‘is fixed‚’ ‘is calm': cf. 1 ξε.

ἓ 4. 8. de istis, ‘of those only?

in confesso sunt, ‘are undisputed': also De Ben. iii 11, 2;
v 17, 5; Nat. Quaest. ii 22, 3; Tac. Dial. 25 and 273 Pliny Nat.
Hist. viii 1 19 uita seruis in confesso longa.

9. acl—concurritur, ‘whose prosperity people flock to see’:
cf. Epp. 98, 9 de his loquitur bonis, ad quae consurritur: millionaires
and great orators excited, as they still excite, public interest.

1 1. multorum is to be taken with both eloquentia and sanguinem.

12. sanguinem educit is to be understood literally : they burst
a blood-vessel owing to their exertions: cf. Dz'al. iv 36, 4 alii nimio
feruore rupere uenas, et sanguinem supra uires elatus clamor egessit ;
Pliny Epp. v 19, 6 (of his reader) dum intente instanterque
pronuntiat, sanguinem reiecit.

14. nihil liberi, ‘no freedom.’

populus has the sense of maguus numerus or multitudo : common
in Sen., e.g. Dial. vii 2, 4 quam magnus mirantz'usu‚ tam magnus
inuidentium populus est.

15. istos here includes great and small: it denotes the inhabi-
tants of Rome in general, as seen in a law-court.

16. pererra, ‘go through at haphazard.⁷ The verbs that follow
all belong to the law-court: aduocat is said of the suitor, adest of
the patronus, periclitatur of the reus, iudicat of the juryman.

17. nemo se sibi uindicat, *but no one asserts his claim to
himself‚' i.e. to his own life and his own time: the verb is again
technical: it would osten be the duty of a patronus to assert the
freedom of (uindicare) his client.

18. in alium, ‘ for the sake of another ἐ see n. to 1 ξ 1.

19. nomina: those, whose ‘names are learned by hem-ts* are
people in the fashion, notoiious for wealth or eloquence: cf. Tac.
Dz'al. 7 (of orators) quorum nomina prius parentes liberis suis
ingerunt? These are no more independent than others.
