alone are long, because, owing to their study of the

to denote those whose minds are ‘engrossed' by the
business or the pleasures of this world, so that they are
unable to devote themselves to philosophy. He does not

some attention to the ordinary business of life, though
elsewhere2 he claims for himself that he could perform the
second duty without neglecting the paramount claims
of the first.

In the course of his address, he says much that is
true about the waste of time, of which most human beings
must plead guilty. But it is clear that his message
is not a gospel which can be received by the bulk of man-
