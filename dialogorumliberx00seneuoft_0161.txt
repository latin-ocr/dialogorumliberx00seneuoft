It is (ι general complaiul among mankind tlzal Nature lcas given

our lzfe z's long enough, is we used z't well ,· bul we squander it
reclelessly.

ᾖ 1.. 1. Pauline: See Introd. p. ix.

2. in, ‘with a view to': this final use os in is common in
silver-age writers (cf. ξ 2 in lam mulla, §3 z'n consummationem),
but was unknown to Cicero, who uses causti with the gen. to express
the same notion : see Madvig Opusc. i ἓ 167.

exiguum aeui, ‘a brief span of life': cs. ἓ 3: the neut. adj. is
used as a noun: cf. Livy xl 28, 4 exiguum temporis; Lucan ii 128
paruum sanguinis: in classical Latin paullum and multum are so
used, but not exiguum or paruum: see Madvig Em. Liu. ἓ 577.

4. spatia is a metaphor from the sace-course, where it means
‘laps': cf. Dz'al. ix 9, 3 non in cursu tantum Cz'rcz'que certamine sed
z'n lais spatiis m'lae interius flectendum est (you must take the inside
course).

5. in ipso ultae apparatu, ‘just when they are getting ready to
live.’ The repetition of uita in different cases is characteristic of
Seneca's style: neither word should be omitted in translating.

6. publico, ‘universal,' has the sense which communis bears in
classieal Latin: cf. Polyb. 14§ 1: Ovid begins the use and has it
often, e.g. M‘et. ii 35 lux inmensi publica mundi(the sun); cf. Pliny
