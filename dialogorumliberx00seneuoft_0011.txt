PREFACE

T cannot be said of Seneca's Dialogues that they
have been over-edited. The Elzevir edition of
Seneca, published at Amsterdam in 1672, contains
the notes of Lipsius and J. F. Gronovius, which,
learned and acute as they are, do not form a con—
tinuous commentary. The edition of Ruhkopf,
published at Leipzig in 1797, added nothing to what
had been done before: imperita neglegentia is all
that Madvig has to say of its author, and he de-
serves it. Yet it is the latest commentary on these
Dialogues ; so that an editor of the present day does
not find much material ready to his hand: most of
his work he has to do for himself.
In the first three sections of the Introduction,
I discuss the subjects of the three Dialogues, their
dates, and the persons to whom they are addressed ;
and here I give some account of the author and some
members of his family, of his exile in Corsica, and
of other matters referred or alluded to in the text.
Some of the arguments by which Ι seek to identify
‘Marcus' with the poet Lucan (pp. li foll.)‚ had been
used before by F. Gloeckner (Rheinisches Museum
