part was pronounced by Dr Johnson to be ‘in a very
high degree delightful and curiousi’ He calls himself
‘the first Briton who has had the curiosity to visit
Corsica.' He looked upon the Corsicans as a nation of
heroes struggling to be free, and was therefore inclined
to find merits in their country. And he certainly found
them. We read in his narrative : ¹ Corsica is a most agree-

Milton has put in the mouth of Satan—

In the matter of trees, at least, it appears from the
statements of ancient writers that Seneca did injustice
to the island. Along the northern shores of the Mediter-

of Theophrastus; and he tells us that the tree was so
called because it grew exceptionally well in Corsicass.
In Pliny’s Natural History, written nearly four hundred
years later than the Botany of Theophrastus and forty
years after the exile of Seneca, we are told that, though
in ancient times no kind of lamus would grow in
Corsica, the difficulty had now been got over4. From
Pliny's statement it is a natural inference that trees of
other kinds grew there with less reluctance. Four
hundred years later, Hunneric the Vandal was king of
