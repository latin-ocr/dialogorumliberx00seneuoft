lee Office of Polybius.

We are told by Suetonius that Polybius held the office
known as a studiis under Claudius. He may have done
so at some time; but it is clear from Seneca’s language
that when this treatise was written he held a different
office, that known as α libellis& The second office was
the more important; and it is likely that he was pro-
moted from one to the other.

This method of naming servants and officials, rare
under the Republie2, became common under the Empire.
As a manu and a pedibus denote personal servants, so
the three chief officials in the household of Claudius were :
(1) a rationibus, ¹ the man in charge of the accounts ' ;
(2) ab epistulis,‘the man in charge of the letters ’;
(3) α libellis, ‘ the man in charge of the petitions.’ The
freedman α rationibus was virtually a finance-minister
controlling the fiscus, into which about two-thirds of
the whole revenue of the empire was paid ; through the
hands of the freedman ab epistulis passed all the official
correspondence with Rome, Italy, and the provinces.
Such posts as these necessarily gave importance to those
who held them, even if they were born foreigners and
slaves. Under Claudius the two offices were long held
by Pallas and Narcissus. Both were freedmen, and both
acquired immense power and wealth. The servility

² There is an instance in Cic. Ad Att. viii 5, 1 seruum α
pedibus meis (meum is often read by conjecture). The idiom
sounds harsh because of the want of a definite article in Latin.
