NOTES (c. 7§3) 117

busy': cf. Epp. 106, 1 districtus occupationibus: found in Cicero,
this sense is constant in Pliny’s Letters: see Mayor on Epp. iii 5, 19.

16. altius recipit, ‘ swallows right down ' : cf. Helu. 10 ἓ 3.

inculcata, ‘ crammed down its throat‚’ if this figure may be used
of the animus.

18. scientia: the ars uiuendi is philosophy, to which Sen. is
working round.

19. uolgo, ‘ everywhere,’ coupled here with an adj.

20. pueri admodum, ‘mere boys’ ε one such art was that of
hair-dressing: cf. Mart. viii 52 tonsorem puerum sed arte talem, Ι
qualis nec Thalamus fuit Neronis, Ι Rufo, Cae-dicione, commodaui.

ita percepisse, ‘to have mastered so completely’: there is a
play on the sound of the two verbs.

21. uiuere is so placed as to suggest the contrast.

tota uita : the abl. is regularly used to express duration of time
by silver-age writers.

22. discendum est mori: the saying (irrelevant here) was no
novelty: Cicero (Tusa. Disp. i 74) attributes it to Socrates: tota
philosophorum uita commentatio mortis est : he is referring to Plato
Phaedo 67 D καὶ τὸ μελέτημα αὐτὸ τοῦτό ἐστι τῶν φιλοσόφων, λύσις
καὶ χωρισμὸς ψυχῆς ἀπὸ σώματος.

§4. 2 3. relictis omnibus impedimentis: similar phrases are
common: cf. Dial. ii 3, 2 omnibus relictis negotiis Stoicus fio ; Nat.
Quaest. vi 32, 12 omnibus omissis lzoc unum ntedz'tczre3 Epp. 5, r
omnibus omissis lzoc unum agis-3 Sen. Conlrou. vii praef. ἓ 4 omnibus
omissis rebus apud Fabianum philosophum sedere; Lucr. iii 1071
iam rebus quisque relictis ξ natm-am primum suadeat cognoscere
rerum. In each of these passages, the phrase is used of a man who
devotes himself exclusively to the study of philosophy. In Cic. Ad
Fam. xii 14, 1 (a letter of Lentulus) omnibus rebus relictis has no
reference to study.

24. officiiS, ‘business’z cf. 3 ἓ 5.

renuntiassent, ‘they had renounced ⁷: cf. Epp. 108, 15 (of
himself, influenced by the philosopher Attalus) inde ostreis
boletisque in omnem uitam renuntiatum est. For a different sense
of the verb, see n. to Polyb. 6 ξ 1.

25. hoc unum...egerunt‚ ‘have made this their one object ³: cf.
De Ben. iii 36, 2 hoc agite, optimi iuuenes. See Munro on Lucr. i 41.
