NOTES (C. 12§2) 271

R. filz'zml‚...fll pondo (12,000 lbs) argenti habuisse apud exercitum
fi’rocz'ssimz's gentihus oppositum scimus. The statement of Suetonius
(lul. 46), that Caesar on his campaigns used to carry about with
him marble floors in sections, is hard or indeed impossible to
reconcile with the rapidity of his movementS.

8. summoueat: I have removed the question-mark aster this
word ζ there is clearly no question.

ξ 3. 9. condicio temporum--special occasions: cf. De clem.
i 2, 1 condicione lcmporltm. That locorum also is governed by con-
dz‘cso, is shown by lz'pp. 123, 3 multae dlfflculsates locorum, mulsae
temporam, eliam locupletibus ef inssrztclis ad uoluptatem prohibentes
occurrens.

10. inopia is therefore abl. ε ⁴ in respect of neediness.’

sumunt, ‘they choose’: there is no compulsion about it: cf.
Epp. 18, 12 aliquos zz'z'es destina, quihus secedas a tuis rebus mini-
moque te facias familiarem. This practice is called by Seu. (Epp.
20, 13) imaginaria paupertas.

12. quibus humi cenent, ‘on which to dine on the ground,
discarding their fme couches and cushions. Sen. and Martial
speak also of paupermn cellae, rooms built in fine houses with an
artifieial imitation of poverty‚ to give the rich the pleasure of a
new sensation ε ef. Sen. Epp. 18, 7 non est nunc quod existimes me
dicere Timoneas cenas et pauperum cellas, ct quicquid aliud est, per
quod luxuria diuitiarum taedio ludim 100, 6 pauperis cella ct
quicquid aliud [naaria non contenta decore simplici miscet (?c0m-
miniscilur); Mart. iii 48 pauperis exstruxit cellam sed uendidit
Olus Ι praedia ; nunc cellam pauperis Olus habet.

Prof. Summers (p. ¹83) suggests that cenae Timoneae were pie-
nies‚ meals taken in the open air. The present passage implies that
those eating them sat on the ground. In modern times the most
famous pauperis cellae were those of Marie Antoinette at Versailles.

13. hoc, ‘this state‚' i-e. poverty.

aliquando—timent: note the double antithesis. It is a false
antithesis, because these jaded revellers never wish to be poor, but
only to feel what it is like.

15. excaecat—paupertatis, necessary to the sense, has fallen
out of the text owing to the repetition of -tatz's.

ξ 4. 17. antiqua has an ethieal sense : see n. to Polyb. 3 ἓ 5.
