NOTES (c. 15 ,δ 1) 153

14. sermo periculosus: talk to living men might be caught
up and reported as treasonable: cf. De Ben. iii 26, 1 sub Ti.
Caesare...excipz'ebatur ebriorum sermo, simplicitas z'ocantium;
ibid. 27, 1 suh diuo Augusto nondum hominibus uerba sua
periculosa erant, iam molesta.

amicitia capitalis : Sen. had seen the friends of Sejanus executed.

15. sumptuosa: the chief sumptus os a Roman client were:
(1) his dress: the toga, an expensive gai-ment, was indispensable;
(2) presents to servants: cf. Juv. 3, 188; (3) a strena or New
Year⁷s gift to the patron himself.

obseruatiozcultus (2 ξ 1).

16. per illos non stabit. quominus, ‘it will not be their fault, if
you do not..) : a common idiom in all Latin.

17. haurias: i.e. they are fontes, from which you can draw
freely.

§2 19. cum quibus: quibuscum is more usual: but Seu.
seems not to use this or quocum, quacum, quicum: cf. Dz'al. v 8,
6; Epp. 6, 2; 10, 2; 24, 13; 25, 6; 45, 9; 104, 293 109, 1.

21. a quibus: (1) ‘from whom‚’ with audiat3 (2) ‘by whom,’
with laudetur.

ἓθ. 24. forte, ‘by chance': as the word is emphatic, casu
would be more usual: but cf. De Ben. i 15, I nec mim cordi esse
cuiquam possunt sorte ac temere dala.

25. nobilis (acc.) I have written sor nobis, which Ι believe to be
corrupt: the emphasis, which its position gives it, is incompatible
with the sense3 for Sen. means that all men, if they choose, can
ally themselves with the illustrious dead. For the consum, licet
nasci nobilis, cf. Epp. 80, 6 non licet palam esse miseram Cic. Pro
Balbo ²9 ciui Romano licet esse Gaditanum: the dat. is the normal
case. .

26. familiae are the different schools of philosophy: cf. Nat.
Quaest. vii 32, 3 tot familiae philosophorum sine successore deficiunt3

Cic. De Fin. iv 49 Aristoteles, Xenocrates, lota illa familia, i.e. the ·

Peripatetics: Sen. makes use of the double meaning of the word.

27. in nomen ι at Rome the adopted child sometimes inherited
the name only, sometimes the property as well: cf. Suet. lul. 83
Caesar, having left Octavius Ξ of his property, in ima cera Octauium
etiam in familiam nomenque adoptauit.
