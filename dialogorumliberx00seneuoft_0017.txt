AD PAVLINVM: DE BREVITATE VITAE.

Incertum ac fragile nimirum est hoc: munus naturae,
quicquid datur nobis, malignum uero et breue etiam in his

quibus largissime contigit. natura nihil hominibus breuitate

uitae praestitit melius. ·
PLINY, Nat. Hist. vii 167.

Paulinus.

This dialogue (which, like the other so-called dia-
logues² of Seneca, is not really a dialogue but a treatise)
is nominally addressed to one Paulinus But, though
he is mentioned in the first line, and Chapters 18 and 19
contain a personal appeal to him by name, yet the
treatise as a whole is not addressed ‘co any individual
but to the reading public of Rome and the Empire. Α

Who this Paulinus was, or what was his connexion
with Seneca, is not certainly known. But this much is
certain, from chapters 18 and 19, that Paulinus was
praefectus annonae, the official whose business it was to
supervise the frumentum publicum—the corn lmported

² They are so called in ‘che chief ms„ and we know (from
Quint. x 1, 129) ‘that Seneca wrote dialogues. Only one,
Dial. ix, has any approach to the form of a dialogue.
