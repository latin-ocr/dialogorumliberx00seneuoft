ἓ 1. 5. uxorem, filium: the only mention of thern: it is rather
surprising that more is not made of them as sources of consolation,
in view of Helu. c. 18.

6. horum are the same as istos (l. 10) and illis (l. 13) : the best
writers, Latin or Greek, do not confuse pronouns in this way: see
n. to Paul. 2 §42 when Thucydides uses αὐτὸς and ἐκεῖνος in the
same sentence of the same man (vi 61, 4), the second is emphatic.

hac tecum portione Fortuna clecIdit, ⁴ Fortune has compounded
with you, in consideration of this percentage': a phrase from
commerce, of the creditor who releases a debtor on payment ol
a certain fraction of the debt: here Fortium, content with one
death, spares the other precious lives: cf. Helu. 16 ἕ 1 ; De Ben.
iv 39, 2 appellare debitorem ad diem possum, et, si foro cesserit
(if he is bankrupt)‚ portionem fhram; Mart. ix 3, 5 conturbabit
Atlas, et non erit uncia tota, Ι decidat tecum (lua pater ipse a'eum
(i.e. Jupiter will not be able to pay ις. 6ιί. in the pound).

8. omnibus is awkward, because it comes so near mins without
being opposed to it: hence, I suppose, the conjecture of Gertz:
uideatur omnibus is in itself unobjectionahle : cf. Helm 12 ξ 4.

9. unus dolor, ⁴ grief for one.'

§a 11. ultro comes near to meaning ‘on the contrary’: it
is osten used to express that the part which you would expect the
agent to play has actually been reversed ε cf. Epp. 77, 8 the dying
Marcellinus summulas distribuit seruis et illos ultro consolatus est
(he did to thern what they should have done to him) 3
Suet. Iul. 63 ultro ad deditionem hortatus (i.e. Caesar might

naturally have surrendered to a superior force; but, far from γ

that, he actually summoned them to surrender); Tac. Hise. i 71
