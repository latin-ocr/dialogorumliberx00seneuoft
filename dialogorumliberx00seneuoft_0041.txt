EXJLE xxxiii

by long disuse1. To his mother lie writes in a very
different strain : he finds it possible to bear his exile,
even with its accompaniments of poverty and disgrace ;
his mind is pleasantly occupied with problems oi
natural science and of philosophy? His real state of
mind we can only guess at: perhaps he was neither
as depressed as the one treatise represents him, nor as
completely victorious over disaster as we are given to
understand in the other. At least, he deserves credit
for a manly spirit, when to his mother he tries to make
light of what was really a crushing disaster. What exile
meant to a Roman of his class, we can judge from the
examples of Cicero and Ovid, two masters of expression,
who have put into words what must have been felt
by many of their less gifted countrymen.

The work contains, as is natural, references to a
number of relations. Seneca mentions his father, then
dead, his two brothers, and several children of the third
generation; he also speaks of his mother's father, still
living at a great age, and ends with a long panegyric
on a sister (or cousin) of his mother's, the widow of a
former governor of Egypt. This lady had been a second
mother to Seneca; and we are told that she showed
remarkable courage, when her husband died during a voy-
age, and also afterwards, when their ship met with some
disasterwhich Seneca dignifies by the name of ship-wreck3.

It is remarkable that Seneca says not a word of his
wife4. Yet he must have been married ; sor he mentions

¹ Polyb. c. 2 §1; c. 18 §q ² Heln. c. 20.

3 Helu. c. 19. If, as seems likely, she was coming from
Egypt to Rome, St Paul, when he was wrecked off Malta, was
taking the same course as Seneca's aunt, some years later.

‘¹ Gercke (Seneca-Studien p. 288) suggests, without a par-
ticle of evidence, that Seneca's first wife accompanied him to
Corsica and died there.
