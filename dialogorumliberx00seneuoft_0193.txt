NOTES (c. 9 ξ 1) 125

24· cogitationes, ‘purposes.’

in longum, ‘ with regard to a distant future ' ; cs. Dz‘al. vii 6, 1
(animus uoluptatibus) futuris iam immineat, ac spes suas ordinet
et...cogz'tat7'0nes ad sutura praemittat.

25. primum quemque, ‘ each as it comes)

26. extrahit, ‘drags from them ’ (not ‘prolongs’): erzspit, which
follows, may have caused the use of this compound.

dum ulteriora promittit, ‘ by her promise of the future ' : the
promise is the instrument by which she robs you of the present.

1. expectatio, ‘the expectant attitude.’

3. quo te extendis, ‘to what point do you push forward ? '

5. protinus uiue: cf. Mart. i 15, 5 non bene distuleris, uideas
quod posse negari ; Ι et solum lzoc ducas, quod fuit, esse tuum. l. 11
non est, crede milti, sapientis dicere ‘ ninellus Ι sera nimis uita est
crastina; uiue lzoa'z'e l Martial means by uiue, ‘enjoy your life';
what Sen. means, is explained in c. 14. See Introd. p. xvi.

ξ 2. maximus uates ε virgil: the verses are from Georg. iii 66 :
quoted again by Sen. Epp. 108, ²4·

6. diuino ore instinctus is a strange phrase, because os
properly belongs, not to the god who inspires, but to the poet
who is his mouth-piece: cf. Quint. xii 10, 24 instinctis diuino
spiritu uatibus. Hence the proposals of critics, in order to remove
the difficulty.

9. occupas, ‘you grasp it instantly’: occupare often implies
haste: cf. Troades 506 miser occupet praesidia, securus legat (the
man at ease may pick and choose his friends, the afflicted must
take the first he can get) ; De Ben. i 7, 1 occasionem, qua prodesset,
et occupauit et quaesiuit. Another meaning, common in Sen., is ‘to
anticipate ’2 cf. Thyestes 403 z'n medio est scelus Ι positum occupanti
(--τῲ“ φθάνον-η, ready for the one who does it first) ; De Ben. iii 27, 1
ut Caesarem occupet (to get hold of the emperor first).

10. et, ⁶ even.‘

11. celeritate—uelocitate : the four words are arranged in the
order known as chia-rmus, one pair of antitheses being separated by
the other pair.
