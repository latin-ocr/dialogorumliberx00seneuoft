CODEX AMBROSJANVS lv

the subject and in sound judgment, has no rival among
living critics of Seneca's text. Madvig‘s work on the
Dialogues will be found in his A dversaria vol. Ι p. 335fi405;
that of Gertz in his Studia Critica (1874) and edition of
the text (1886). Few ancient writings needed correction
so sorely‚ and few have been corrected with as much
skill and certainty.

Of the Dialogues of Seneca by far the best manuscript
is the Codex At'nbrosiamts (generally referred to as A)
written in a Lombard hand about the beginning of the
11th century1. Once the property of the great Benedic-
tine monastery of Monte Cassino‚ it came to the Ambro-
sian Library at Milan, where it is now, in 1603. The
scribe was honest and tried to reproduce what was before
him; but he knew little Latin and apparently had
difficulty in deciphering the original, so that the manu-
script was at first full of mistakes. Afterwards it was
repeatedly revised: the latest collators distinguish the
hands of five different correctors who have worked upon
it between the 12th and 15th centuries‚ of whom some
did good and others harm. As well as normal mistakes
of every kind, there is one singular form of error in the
ms., very common in Dialogue vi and seldom found in the
others, by which words are given in a mutilated form:
thus suaserit appears as sna in vi 12, 2, querella as qma
in x 2, 2, integro domus statu integer ipse as inte domus
status inte ipse in vi 26, 23 and in ix 5, 1 Gertz reads,
with great probability, augustabatm, for angusta of A.
Of normal errors the commonest is that by which, when
a word is repeated at a short interval, the intervening
words are omitted, the eye of the copyist passing insen-
sibly from the first occurrence of the word to the second.
Many such passages have been corrected ; ’ Ι may refer
to a puzzling sentence in Dial. xi (Polyb. 10 ξ 3), where
