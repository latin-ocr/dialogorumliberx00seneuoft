1. mhil: adv.

2. eum poneretur, ‘when it was taken off': Seu. alludes to
the transparent Chinese silks, which all Roman satirists and
moralists disapprove os: cf. De Bm. vii 9, 5 (in a list of luxuries)
m'deo sericas uestes, si uestes necandae sunl, in quibas nz‘ln'l est quo
defendi aut empus aul deniqne pudor possit.

strange to us ; but perhaps Roman taste was not shocked by it.

unicum—pudicitia : the sentence has onlyv one subject, pudicitia,
and three predicates, ornamenlzmn,simma, and ‹za-cns.

Cf. Tempest iii ι, 53 ‘My modesly, the jewel in my (lowe1·';

dsritur, Ι sed pudicitiam et pudorem.

ἓ 5. 5. ad optinendum dolorem, ‘in order to make good your

expected to make more allowance for your sorrow.

intabescere uolneri ε for the dat„ cf. Polyb. 5 ξ 2.

9. maerore cito defunctam, ‘to make haffite and get done
with your mourning': this sense of day‘lmgi‚ common iu all prose-
writers, is best shown by examples: cf. Diczl. iv 14, 5 qui primis
defimgi malis potuimus (when we might have suffered once and
never again), in maiora dezwluimnr3 Dz'al. vi 22, 3 si felicissi-
mum cst non nasci, proximum puta brem? aetate deflmclos cito ῐη
integrum reslz'lztz'3 Epp. 99, 10 ‘sed puer decessit? mondum dico
melius agi cum ee, <lui uita defimgslm' (who gets off with a short
lise); ib. 120, 14 scit in lzoc natum lzomz'nem'ut m'la dffhngerestcr

ceptori plus quiddam debeo nec aduersus illos mercede defungor (why
can I not pay their fee and have done with them ?); Nat. Quaest.
vi 1, 2 Campaniam uunquam securam huius mali, indemnem
tamen et tollens defmzclam metu (that has so often got off with a
fright). In each os these instances, the verb is followed by an
ablative expressing the circumstance or action, which, when it is
over, relieves the agent from further trouble.
