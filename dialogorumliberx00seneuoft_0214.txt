ultimo mancipio. ‘the meanest of slaves’: cf. Dial. v 37, 2
extremo manceps& vi 20, 4 (os Pompey) corpus satelliti praestitit:
i.e. Achillas, who stabhed P. first, after which Septimius cut offdiis
head (Lucan viii 618, 668).

6. intellecta: the time of this action is simultaneous 'with that
ospraebm't; for P. never realised the truth till the moment of death.
This inexact use of the past participle is found occasionally: cf.
Lucan iii 126 Crassumque z'n bella secutae Ι sacua tribuniciae uoue-
rmzt (imprecated) proelia dirae, where the aetion described by
seculae follows the action described by nonerunt. Yet it seems that
Sen. might have written intellegens here.

7. cognominis ε P. was born 106 B.C.‚ fought for Sulla in Italy,
Sicily, and Africa 83-81 B.C.‚ and, on his return to Rome, was
greeted by Sulla as Magnus, a (agnomen inherited by his sons. Lucan

properly be said ducere aliquid ante currtcm3 sor a man (lucit quod
sequitur, but agit quodpraccedil: therefore duxisse means ‘caused to
be led' ε there was a similar use of complet 7 §8‚ where see n. The
human captives led in triumphs are generally spoken of as preceding
the car: exceptions are Troades 162 currusque sequens Agamemno-
m'os Ι [αἰῶ-βα pompa Mycem'5; Lucan iii 77 celsos ut Gallia currus Ι
nobilis elstauis sequerelur mixta Britannis.

13. protulisse pomerium: this passage helps to date the
Dialogue: see Introd. p. xii.

The pomerium (derived by the Romans from post and murus)
was a space, kept sacred from occupation, on either side of the
city wall (Livy i 44, 4lz within this space the auspices, at Rome,
