NOTES (e. 10 § 7) 263

28. quorum uinus —sustentat‚ ‘whose virtues to this day prop
up our vices': i.e. if we, vicious as we are, have not come to utter
ruin, we owe it to their virtues: ef. Sall. Cat. 53 §5 (of public
men in his youth) res publica magnitudine sua imperatorum atque
magistratuum uitia sustentabat.

etiamnunc, ‘to this day‚’ ‘up till now' z see n. to Paul. 13 ἓ 3.

²9· parabant, ‘ procured’: cf. Juv. 14, 181 panem quaeramus
aratro. parabant could mean ‘cooked’3 but this anticipates the
story of Curius below.

page ‘76

2. fictiles, ‘of baked clay': before the images of the gods
were made of gold or marble‚ oaths sworn by the gods were kept:
cf. Epp. 31, 11 non potest ex lzac materia (gold and silver) imago
dei exprimi similis: cogita illos, cum propitii essent, fictiles ficz'ssc;
Juv. 11, 115, llam* rebus Latiis curam praestare solebat Ι fictilis et
nullo uiolatus luppiter auro.

3. ad hostem...redibant: the reference is to Regulus : the use
of the plur. implies that Regulus was typical of contemporary
Romans.

morituri, ‘though doomed to die.'

ἓ 8. 4. dictator noster: Manius Curius : one of the great Roman
heroes, e.1·act1'ss2'ma norma Romanae frugalitatis (Val. Max. iv 3, 5) :
Pliny (Nat. Hz'st. xxxvi 111) speaks of Nero's Golden House, and
adds : nimirum sic lrabz'tauerant illi, qui hoc imperium fecere
tantum, ad deuincendas gentes tm'umplzosque referendos ab aratro
aut foco exeuntes!

5. audiit, ‘gave audience to ’τ but, as Curius refused a present
of gold offered him by the Samnites, we should rather expect repudi-
auit: see Pliny and Cicero below and Val. Max. iv 3, 6 repudiatis
donis : the tense, too, audiit instead of audiebat, is suspicions : is it
possible that the first four letters of repudiauit have been lost and
the last six shuffled?

uilissimum cibum: turnips, as we learn from Pliny lVat. Hz'st.
xix 87 M '. Curium κήιρεναίονέυι, quem ab hostium legatis, aurum
repudiaturo miserentibus, rapum torrentem insece inuentum, annales
nostri prodld're; cf. Cic. Cato 56 Curio adsocum sedenti magnum
auri pondus Samnites cum attulissent, repudiati stmt.
