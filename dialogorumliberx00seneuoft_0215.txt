NOTES (c. 13 ξ 8) 147

pomerium, differs in some respects froin the account given here:
he says (1) that the right to extend it belonged to anyone who, by
taking hostile territory, papulum Romanum alsteram (2) that
Julius Caesar extended it. Tacitus also differs from this account
in saying (Ann- xii 23, 5) that Augustus extended it.

16. Auentinum montem: the Aventine, south-west of the
Palatine and separated from it by the circus-valley, though included
in the Servian wall, was outside the pomerium till the reign of
Claudius (Tac. l.l.).

17. duabus causis : Gellius (l. l. ) reports that Messalla, a writer
on augury, gave his authority to the second reason given here for
exclusion.

19. non addixissent, ‘had not been favourable': a technical
term of augury: cf. Livy xxvii 16, 15 Fabio auspicandi aues
semel atque ilerum mm addixerunt. According to Livy's account,
Remus first sighted six vultures from the Aventine, and then Romulus
twelve from the Palatine; and number prevailed over priority (Livy
i 6, 7).

20. tarta: rare in this sense, for referta: hence the proposals
to emend: cf. Epp. 33, 2 eiusmodi uocibus referta sunt carmina3
76, 4 illud quidem (the theatre)farlum est (is crammed).

ἕ 9. 21. fide bona, ‘honestly ' z this phrase and also bona fide
(e.g. Helu. 17 ἓ 5) occur often in Sen.

ut ad praestationem scribant, ⁴ even though they pledge thern-
selves to the truth os what they write⁷z such seems to be the
meaning of this legal phrase.

22—24. errores minuent cet.: i.e. none of the four cardinal
virtues, wisdom, temperance, courage‚ and justice, will be promoted
by these studies: a fifth virtue, liberalitas, not a cardinal virtue,
is then added.

errores in Seu. is often :falsae opiniones, a wrong estimate of
the gifts of fortune: the wise man estimates these at their true value-

ε 5. interim <z interdum) goes, 1 think, with dubitare.

Fabianus: see n. to 10§ 1.

26. studiis, ‘studies‚' ‘researches’ : common in silver Latin;
Cicero would not use it so without an epithet.

admoueri, ‘to apply oneself' z middle, not passive.

implicari, ⁶ to get entangled.’
