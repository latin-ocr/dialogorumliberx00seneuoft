240 AD HEL VlAM

Pro Mil. 20, Post Red. ln Seu. 31 and 38, Post Red. Ad Quz'r. 10: in
all these passages, the context proves that the reference is to Italy
exclusively‚ though there were municipia and coloniae in many
provinces of the Empire.

2. ambitio :pett'lz'o honorum t cf. Paul. 2 ἓ 1.

About 106 A.D. Trajan required all candidates for office to
invest one-third of their wealth in Italian land, deforme arbitratus
honorem petituros urbem Italiamque mm pro patria sed pro hospitio
aut stabulo quasi peregrinantes halvere (Pliny Epp. vi 19, 4). Those
who wished to be quaestors must cease to be ‘ carpet-l)aggers.’

3. officium publicum is office of a less distinguished kind than
honores, ranging from a procuratio such as an eques might hold,
down to much humbler occupations.

inposita legatio, ‘the duty of deputy imposed upon them ’t
i.e. they have been sent to Rome to represent their native place in
the matter of some request or grievance. These, however, would
not spend their whole lives at Rome.

4. opportunum et, opulentum uitiis, ⁴ that offers a field for the
vicious and abounds in vices': uitiis is dat. with opportunum and
abl. with opulentum.

5. liberalium studiorum: we hear less of Rome as a place
of higher education than of Athens, which remained the chief centre
of philosophie instruction, until her schools were closed by Justinian
in 529 A.D. ; but the best rhetores were probably to be found there,
even before Quintilian began to teach in 67 A.D.: the chief gram-
malici at Rome under Tiberius and Claudius were Μ. Pomponius
Marcellus, Q. Remmius Palaemon, and M. Valerius Probus (Suet.
De Gramm. 22-24).

6. speetacula: apart from special occasions, there was one
kind of spectaele which could be enjoyed at Rome only, the
Circenses or chariot-races. The provincial towns had theatresfor
plays, and amphitheatres for gladiatorial shows; but they had no
Circus: hence in Juv. 3, 223 anelli Circensibus:Romam relin-
quere. We often hear of the crouds which gathered on special
occasions: cf. Suet. lul. 39 (of Caesar's ganies in 46 B.C.) adquae
omnia spectacula tantum undique confluxit (cf. l. 2) hominum, ut
plerique aduenae aut inter uicos aut inter uias tabernaculis positis
manerent, ac saepe prae turba elisi exanimalique sint plurimi.
