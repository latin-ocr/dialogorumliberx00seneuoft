1. rumpentibus-:qui rumpere solent: a convenient but not a
classical use of the pres. participle : see n. to destruentis, Polyb. 1 ξ 1.

The salutatio took place at a very early hour: cf. Juv. 5, 19
lzabet Trebius propter quod rumpere somnum Ι debeat.

alienum somnumxthe end of another man's sleep ε for this 'use
of expectare, P. Thomas quotes Tac. Dial. 20 quis quinque in Verrem
libros expectabit (who would have patience to hear to the end... ?) :
the use is much the same as De Ben. iii 27, 4 mm expectas us silai
narrem (you know without my telling you).

z. uix adleuatis labris: cf. clauso labello of Juvenal, quoted
on 2 ἓ 5: the quotation seems to show that the labra are not, as
Hermes supposes, those of the uomemulalor. This appears to be
inconsistent with ‘yawning ἐ but perhaps om‘tau'o ismerely ‘opening
of the mouth': cf. oscitet, Helu. 13 ξ 7.

insusurratum ε the nomenculator repeats the caller’s name
many times in a whisper3 the great man at last catches it and
manages to get it out in the middle of a yawn. In case you could
not remember a man's name, there was a semblance of resource:
cf. E pp. 3, 1 obuios, si nomen non succurrit, ‘dominos ' salutamus.

3. reddent has no sense of ‘restoring ⁷ : reddere nomina is ⁴ to
call people by their right names': cf. De Ben. i 3, 10 memoriae
loco audac-ui est, el, cuicumque nomeu non potest reddere, imponit
(he christens him afresh); Pliny Nat. Hz'st. vii 88 Cyrus rer omnibus
in exercitu suo militibus nomina reddidit.

ἕ 5. 4. ueris officiis: Sen. avails himselfof the double meaning
of qfficz'a 2 (1) social duties ; (2) moral duties (τὰ καθήκοντα).

licet dieamus, ⁴ we may fairly say.⁷

5. cotidie, in spite of its position, does not apply to Pytha-
goras more than to the other names. Pythagoras is not appropriate,
as he left no writings, apparently. The names are chosen so as
not to repeat those given in ἓ 2 ; otherwise the omission of Plato
would be unaccountable: above he is represented by Socrates.
But, as Sen. was a Stoic, the Stoics are referred to in both places·‚
and Zeno, their founder, is put first here.

antistites: the writers are called ‘priests,' because their theme
is sacred: cf. Dz'al. vii 26, 7 suspicite (look up to) uirtutem‚...et
