NOTES (c. 7 ξ 6) 247

ualz'dz'orz's shows that gentibus, not nominibus, is to be supplied
with prioribus.

4. publica, ‘of a nation.’

7—9. Evander, an Arcadian prince, settled on the site of Rome
before the Trojan war ; Antenor, a Trojan, and Diomedes, a Greek,
reached Italy after the war and founded cities there. Such were
the legends.

ξ ’1. 10. Romanum imperium, ‘the Roman empire itself':
the Latin order makes it unnecessary to add ipsum.

auctorem, ‘as its founder.' Some of the phrases here are taken
from the first lines of the Aeneid.

12. uictoris metus: in the Aeneid, the paramount motive of
Aeneas is the divine command.

13. deinde, ‘in turn ¹:p017'0 and rursus are more often used in
this sense.

15. ubicumque uicit Romanus, habitat: a pointed way of
saying that colonisation always came after conquest, followed the
flag, as we might say. The solidity of the Roman empire was
largely due to a well-planned colonial system.

Gibbon (chap. ΙΙ) confirms this ‘ veryjust observation of Seneca ⁷
by the fact that ‘ about forty years after the reduction of Asia, eighty
thousand Romans were massacred in one day, by the cruel orders of
Mithridates-³

ad, ⁴ with a view to.’

16. nomina dabant: Roman colonists were not adventurers:
commissioners were appointed deducendae coloniae, and citizens
‘gave in their names’ at Rome as volunteers. They were con-
ducted to their destination like an army, sub uexillo, and formed
a garrison of the place where they settled. The colonia was a
town, not a colony in our sense of the word.

17. colonos senex, mss. ε Madvig proposed colonus uexillmn:
who ever heard, he asks, of one old man, who left his altars to follow
colonists who were all young and did not leave their altars? But
it seems possible that senex might be = senes (cf. ἓ 3), and that
rellclz's aris suis might apply also to colonos. ‘ They left their own
altars behind, and even the grey-beard went with the colonists across
the seas.’

ξ 8. 18. plurium, ‘of more instances.'
