144 AD ΡΑ VLJNVM

omnia extra publicas tabulas sunt (i.e. many virtues are not laid
down in the written law). The same term is often used for the ‘state
archives ⁷ kept in the Temple of Sanun: cf. Tac. Ann- xiii 28, 3 2 but
treaties‚ decrees of the senate, and similar documents were engraved
on metal: cf. Pliny Nat. Hz'sf. xxxiv 99 usus aeris aa'peaepetm'tatem
monimentorum iam· pridem tralatus est, tabulis aereis, in quibus
publicae constitutiones imittuntur: so that Sen. does not here refer
to them.

7. subvehunt, from Ostia to Rome: the crews formed a eor-
poration called codic-arii, as appears from inscriptions.

ξ 5. 8. sane, ‘if you like.'

ad rem pertineat, ⁴ be considered i1nportant.'

9. Coruinus took Messana 263 13.C.

ἓ 6. ¹3- hoc...curare‚ ‘to be interested in the fact.'

Sulla: Pliny (Nat. Hz'st. viii 53) reeords that Sulla exhibitcd
a hundred maned lions at Rome during his praetorship.

14. circo: until the Colosseum was opened by Titus in 80 A.D.,
wild beasts were regularly baited in the Circus. Caesar made a
moat in the Circus for his games in 46 B.C., to ¹prevent the animals
from breaking out, as the elephants, shown by Pompey nine years
earlier, had done, with injury to the spectators.

dedit, ‘exhibited’ : the technieal word, regularly used with
bestias, ludos, munus, gladiatores etc.

alioquin, ‘at other times’: cf. Dz'al. i 2, 2: here-:anteaz for
another meaning, cf. Polyb. 18 ξ 5 ; Helu. 10 ξ 5.

¹5· ad conficiendos eOS, ‘to despatch them’: the word seems
technical: cf. Suet. Dom. 19 feras saepe in Albano secessu confi-
cientem spectauere plerique: so consector, Dial. v 43, 2.

17. Pompeium: Pornpey, when his theatre was opened in
55 B.C., exhibited elephants (20, 18, or 17 according to different
accounts). which were baited in the Circus. Cicero was one of the
spectatores, but was not amused τ he writes to a friend (Fam. vii 1, 3)
extremus elephantorum dies fuit, in quo admiratio magna uolgi
atque turbae, delectatio nulla exstitit: quin etiam misericordia
quaedam consecuta est atque opinio eiusmodi, esse quandam illi
beluae cum genere humano societatem. Pliny (Mzt. Hzssvt. viii 21)
says that the spectators were so tilled with pity for the elephants that
they uttered against Pompey curses which were soon to be fulfiued.
