AD HELVIAM MATREM.

En ego, cum patria caream uobisque domoque
raptaque sint, adimi quae potuere, mihi,
ingenio tamen ipse meo comitorque fruorqtte.
Caesar in hoc potuit iuris habere mln'l!
QVID, Trist. iii 7, 45.

I

Senecafs Exile.

This treatise was addressed by Seneca, living in
banishment at Corsica, to his mother Helvia at Rome.
It seems to have been written not later than the summer
of 43 A.D.1; he was banished at some date in 41, the
first year of the reign of Claudius. He was then about
45 years old. His offence, if we may trust Dion
Cassius2‚ no lover of Seneca, was an intrigue with the
princess Julia, one of the sisters of Caligula ; the empress
Messalina used her infiuence to expe] both Julia and
Seneca from Italy.

The purpose of the treatise is to console Helvia for
the loss of her son, and to assure her of his well-being
and happiness. To Polybius he represented himself as
a mere wreck, with hope gone and faculties impaired

¹ For this date, see n. to c. 10, §2. Gercke (Seneca-
Studien p. 286) argues that the letter to Helvia was written
before the letter to Polybius; but there is no evidence that
the former was written either before or after the latter.

2 lx 8 z he says that Messalina was influenced partly by
jealousy of Julia's beauty. The Scholiast on Juv. 5, 109
(who seems to have had1 good information) says of Seneca:
sid> Claudio quasi conscius adulteriorum Iuliae Germanici filiae
in Corsicam relegatus est.
