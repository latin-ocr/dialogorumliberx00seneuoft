286 AD HEL VJAM

12. uiros: cf. Pliny Epp. vii 19, 7 (of Fannia, daughter of
Thrasea) a qua uiri quoqucfin'tz'ludz'nzk exempla sumamus.

ge. Corneliam: the younger daughter of the elder Scipio:
a statue of this woman, ⁶ famed as the model of a great and large-
minded Roman lady ² (Heifflmd), was erected by the Roman people
with this inscription: CORNELIA MATER GRACCHURUM. She was
represented as sitting, and wearing sandals without straps (Pliny
Nar. Hz'st. xxxiv 31).

exzafter having had ι an imitation os a Greek construction.

13. redegerat: ef. Ovitl Am. vi 197 (Niobe speaking) fingite
deam 1 lzm'c aliquid populo natorum posse meorum, l mm lamen ad
numerum redigar spoliala duorum : Niobe also, according to some
accounts, had six sons and six daughters.

numerare, aestimare: both quantity and quality were present,
to make her loss the heavier.

14. Gracchos: apparently, from what follows, the tribunes
Tiberius and Gaius. But there is some fault here. Plutarch says
clearly (T. Gracch. 1) that of her twelve children, six boys and six
girls, born alternately (Pliny ΜΝ. Hz'sl. vii 57), Cornelia lost nine
in their childhood, the three survivors being the tribunes and a
daughter, who married the younger Africanus. Seneca's words
cannot be explained, unless two ofher children survived the death
of Gaius.

15. se and eius both refer to Cornelia: the variation is sur-
prising, but Sen. perhaps thought that sillum sumn would be
ambiguous.

17. dedisset: Bentley and, later, Madvig wished to substitute
adcmz'ssel: “1 think Madvig’s adcml'sscl spoils the sense. dedisset
means: ‘ when you bid me mourn the loss of the Gracchi, you bid
me blame Fortune sor having given ine such sonsa* ⁴ ’Tis better to
have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.³ ”—J. E. B. M. in
Bohn Transl. p. 345. The other version of the same saying in Dial.
vi 16, 3 (numquam uon filicem me dicam, qnae Gracchos peperi) is
certainly in favour of dedisses.

ex hac femina, debuit nasci : ⁴ she was the right mother for the
man who....' Sen. refers to a phrase ‹›f Gaius, which was more
modest than he represents it: ct‘. l'lut. (ι’. (irasc. 4 ‘cfr γὰρ’ ἔφη
’Κορνηλίαν λοιδορεῖς τὴν Τιβέριον τεκοῦσαν ”
