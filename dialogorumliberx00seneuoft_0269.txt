NOTES (c. 11 ξ 5) 201

15. utriuslibet auctoris: Homer or Vir-gil: it is osten said
that (ιω-[ον never is used as=scrzj⁷l0r3 but surely it is so here.

16. ita resoluisti cet.‚ ⁸ you have so transmuted‚ that, though
their metrical form has disappeared, their charm is fully preserved
nevertheless.' It appears therefore that Pol. had translated Homer
into Latin prose and Virgil into Greek prose.

18. alia : one would expect altera.

20. alienam orationem, ⁶ the foreign language’ : eg. to
Homer, Latin is aliena oratio, ‘the speech of other people.'

21. nullus liber: ⁶ Homer ³ contains 48 libri, and virgil
twelve (the context suggests that his Aeneid only was translated).

eritzz'mmu'etm- esse : see n. to Paul. 6 ξ 4.

23. ex alia atque alja eausa, ‘ for different reasons in different
cases' : cf. ἓ 4.

ἓ 6. 24. legezread and mark : lt3ge‚...pudebit=sitigres, pudebil.

intonueris: intonare and tonare are used metaphorically (1) of
an angry man, speaking loud (Livy iii 48, 3 ; Juv, 6, 485); (2) of a
writer of epic verse or trage ly : cf. Mart. vii 23, 1 bella tonanti (of
Lucan); viii 3, 14 paribus bella tonare modim Stat. Sila. v 3, 96
qm· fitrz'as regumque dolos auersaque caelo 1 sidera terrifico super
intonuere cothurno: here the word implies that Pol. preserved the
epic tone in his translations.

25. rebus, ⁶ over the theme ’ of Homer and Vir-gil. For rebus
Bentley proposed uerbis, abl. of the instrument: this is a more
usual constr„ and ingentibus uerbis is so used by Tac.D1·al. 35:
but, for rebus, cf. Quint. i 8, 5 (he is· saying that Homer and virgil
are the best authors for children when they begin to read) sublz'mz'lalss
heroici carminis animus assungrczt, et ex lllagnz'llcdz‘ne rerum spiritum
ducat.

26. ne commiseris ut, ‘do not let it happen, that...’: cf.
Dz'czl. iv 6, 2 uec umquam committet uirtus, zat uilia, dum compescit,
imitetur: a favourite turn with CicerO.

27. exempto modo--sz'ne modo, ‘without bounds' x cf. Lucr. i
