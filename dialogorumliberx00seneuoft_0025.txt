employed, if he had taken Seneca's advice, thrown up
his post, and devoted his life to the study of Stoic
science—the shape of the gods, the destiny of the soul,
the motions of the heavenly bodies1 ? Even the pursuit
of commerce, which Seneca utterly condemns, has not
always been considered unfavourable to virtue. ‘ There
are few ways,' said a great master of practical life, ‘in
which a man can be more innocently employed than in
getting money2.' The ideal life preached by Seneca
is quite as selfish in its object as that of the business-man,
and more so than that of the public servant,

The emperor Gaius who, for all his madness, could
say shrewd and caustic things, once declared that Seneca's
writings were commissiones, ‘ prize-exercises,' exhibitions
of cleverness, with no element of solid truth in themss.
Even an admirer of Seneca can hardly deny that the
present treatise does lie open to this criticism. It
sounds fantastic and hollow, when compared, I will not
say, with the noble earnestness of Lucretius, but with
the common-sense of Quintilian, who in a somewhat
similar passage blames his contemporaries for wasting
in less worthy pursuits the time which they might devote
to the study of oratory4. For Quintilian was in earnest :

contemnens, ut Senecam, tum maxime placentem, commissiones
meras componere, et harenam esse sine calce (sand without lime)
diceret. Cf. Suet. Aug. 89 ; Augustus warned the magistrates
ne paterentur nomen sunm commissionibus obsolefieri : he
resented ‘ birth-day odes ' by incompetent authors. The
second criticism of Caligula is often justified : Seneca's com-
position is too loose in structure.
