os the senate to Pallas is the subject of a bitter letter of ἶ
Pliny's1. We are told that Pallas amassed g3,ooo‚ooo ¹
and Narcissus g4‚ooo,ooo 2. When Claudius complained ς

that the imperial treasury wanted funds, he was told
that, if he were taken into partnership by his two freed-
men, he would have a great balance³.

Polybius never soared to these heights ; but it seems
that he served Claudius successively as a studiis and

a libellis; and it is clear that he was a person of no ᾗ

small importance and wealth.
That he held the former post is probable‚ apart from

the statement of Suetonius. For Seneca insists on his

early familiarity with literature and his distinction as ’

an author. The business of this official was to assist the

reigning emperor in literary work of any kind as dis— Ἴ
tinguished from official business. In some cases he was ³
imperial librarian as well. In 89 A.D. Martial addressed l
an epigram to Sextus, who was serving Domitian in J

both capacities. ‚He says:

‘ Learned Sextus, worshipper of Wisdom in the ¹
Palaee, you enjoy close contact with the genius of our ’

god’ (i.e. Domitian). ‘For you can watch the works
of our lord in their birth and learn the inmost thoughts
of our sovereign. Beside Pedo, Marsus, and Catullus,
please find some place ior my poems too; but set the

¹ Epp. viii 6: his bitterness was caused by reading the
actual decree in which the senate had voted the praetoria
ornamenta and a sum of money to Pallas. This ‘ fastidiosissi-
mmn mancipium ' died in 62 A.D., poisoned, it was believed,
by Nero for his money.

the largest private fortune recorded in antiquity : libertinae ’

opes soon became proverbial.
