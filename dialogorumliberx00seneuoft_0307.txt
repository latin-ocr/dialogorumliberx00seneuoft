NOTES (c. 6 ξ 1) 239

aufert, ‘carries off,' i.e. ‘masters' : tram-uersos is often added
to auferre in this sense ε eg. Dial. vi 6, 3.

20. ne uidear cet.: there is an ellipse here: some words like
‘ I tell you ' must be inserted after subtrahere : such an ellipse is not
uncommon in Latin: cf. 19 ἓ 6; Virg. Ecl. 3, ²3 sz' nescis, meus ille
caper ficz'l3 and see n. to Juv. 5, 159.

21. quidquid pessimum in se habet: cf. JuV. 3, 152 nil habet
z'n elix paupertas durius z'n se.

22¹. sequuntur, ‘are attached to’: the word does not mean

the two senses of sequi, comp. Epp. 107, 8 noctem dies sequitur with
Medea 406 <lum solem dies, Ι noctem sequentur asna, where sequi has

suspicione (areat (were free from), animo aequo se carere (can do
without) suis omnibus commodis dicit.

28. hano frequentiam: istam would be more correct, in the
circumstances; but possibly ham· is ‘ of our tirne' z cf. Paul. 10 ξ 1.

Bentley, in his copy, changed hanc to istam.

The population of Rome cannot be precisely estimated; Fried-
l'ander is of opinion, judging partly by the number of those who

Furneaux, giving many instauces ot this phrase from Tacitus (on
