NOTES (c. 5 ξ 1) 111

Ι do not remember that Cicero, though he bitterly regretted the
consequences, anywhere quite curses the glorious Nones of December:
but he wrote to his brother from exile (i 3, 1) meus ille laudatus
consulatus mihi te, patriam, fortunas eripuit.

ἓ 2. 15. ad Atticum: in the extant letters to Atticus, the words
here quoted do not occur. But in May 45 B.C., soon after the
battle of Munda, Cicero wrote to Atticus from his villa at Tusculum
thus : semz'lz'bcri saltem simus, quod adsequentur el tacendo et latendo
(AdAtt. xiii 31, 3). Two explanations are possible. Either Cicero
repeated this phrase in another letter, not extant, of the same time ;
or Sen., remembering the one important word (semiliber), invented
the rest of the sentence. Misquotation in ancient writers has wide
limits: it has recently been suggested (by Mr F. W. Hall) that this
inaccuracy is due in part to the great trouble of verifying quotations
in rolls of the ancient form.

16. adhuc, ⁶ still,' where the classical writers would use eliam
tum ε with them, adlzuc always refers to the present and means ⁵ up
to this time.⁷

filio: Sextus Pompeius.

17. refouente, ‘was trying to rekindle’: the metaphor may
be from nursing an invalid or nursing a fire: cf. Suet. lul. 35
Scffiionem ac Iubam reliquias partium in Africa refouentis dem'cz‘t,
Pompeii liberos in Hispania. Pharsalia was fought in Aug. 48 B.c.‚
Thapsus in April 46, Munda in March 45.

18. alia deinceps cet. ; there is nothing of this kind in Cic. Ad
Att. xiii 31 ‚ so that the hypothesis osa lost letter seems the more likely.

§a 21. me hercules: a favourite expletive with Sen.‚ used
esp. after at and tam: there are at least 19 examples in his Dialogues,
and 31 in his Letters to two of me hercule: he never omits the me,
as many writers, e.g. the younger Pliny, commonly do3 nor does he
use hercle. Cic. uses all these forms, but me hercules least often.
See Friedlander Cena D‘imalclz. p. 211.

22. Samene, ‘ the Sage‚' the Perfect Man of the Stoics, whom
they admitted to be as rare as the Phoenix : some considered
Hercules, some Odysseus, to have reached the high ideal : in Sen., Κ
perfect virtue is generally represented by Socrates and, still more,
by Cato: cs. Dz'al. ii 2, 1 Catonem...certius exemplar sapientis
uiri ...quam Vlixen et Herculem prioribus sacculis. The word
