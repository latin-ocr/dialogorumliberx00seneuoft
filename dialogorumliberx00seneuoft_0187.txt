NOTES (c. 7 ξ 7) 119

13. candidatus: office being now conferred by the votes os
the senate, a candidate‘s supporters (szgffragatores) canvassed the
senators. That much time might be spent thus by loyal backers,
is shown by several letters of Pliny's: eg. ii 9 anxium me et
sollicitum habet petitio Eruci mei. ...prenso amicos, supplico,
ambio, domos stationesque cz'rcume0; cf. ibid. iv 15, vi 6 and 9.

anus: the old lady, having buried all her natural heirs, is now orba,
so that will-hunters spend their time in paying court to her ε cf. 2 ἓ 2.

15. simulatus aeger, ‘ sham invalid.' The illness is shammed
to stimulate the liberality of the captatores: cf. Mart. v 39 supremas
tibi triciens in anno Ι sig-nanti tabulas, Charine, misi Ι Hyblaeis
madidas thymis placenlas. Ι dejfhci: miserere iam, Charine. Ι signa
rarius, aut semel fac illud, Ι mentitur lua quod subinde tussis.

16. uos, ‘you and your like': Sen. substitutes uos for te,
to show concisely that the great man has more than one retainer.

non—apparatu, ‘not to be his friends but as a part of his
grandeur': apparatus often=‘pomp,' ‘magnificence.’ The great
man likes plenty of clients, to make a show when they call upon
him in the morning and escort him about the streets.

17. dispunge, ‘balance’z lit. ‘mark down on both sides'
of the account: cf. De Ben. iv 32, 4 apud me istae expensorum
acceptorumque rationes dz'spunguntur.

18. reicu108, ‘derelict’z days which no one else wanted.
ridiculos of mss. is meaningless: the rare word evidently puzzled
the copyist53 but Sen. has many rare words. There can be little
doubt that in Epp. 47, 9 reicula mancipia should be read, as it
used to be, for ridicula m. of mss.

resedisse = residuos fuisse.

ξ Β. 20. subinde is the French sozcveaezt. The office of consul
expired at the end of the year3 but, under the empire, few men
held it for a whole year: see n. to 20 ἓ 1.

21. facit...1uclos=dat ludos : for a different meaning, cf. Polyb.
16 ἓ 2. The praetor is mentioned next to the consul ς for, under the
empire, it was the duty of the praetor to manage the public shows :
see n. to Juv. 8, 194.

quorum sortem cet.‚ ‘the chance of giving which, he once
reckoned a great piece of luck’ : presumably it was the office the
man coveted and not the expensive duties attached to it.
