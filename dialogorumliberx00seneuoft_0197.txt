animum, ‘ their thoughts.'

23. quorum: the antecedent is not ea, but ii which must
be supplied.

24. surripiebantur, ‘were disguised⁷; lit. ⁸ smuggled out of
sight’: cf. Quint. iv 1,¹ 78 oratori quid est necesse surripere lianc
transgressionem (to slur over this transition)?

2 5. retractando : cf. pertractandum, Polyb. 10 ξ 3 : the subject
of the gerund is different from the subject of the sentence: cs.
Lucr. i 312 anulus in digito subter tenuatur habendo (z διὸ. τὸ φορεῖν
ἡμᾶς)-

26. sua is emphatic: the fault of most men is, that they live
sub censura aliena.

shortness of present time.

10. omnes: sc. dies.

12. quod—non uacat τ this was said before in ξ 2.

ξ ⁵. 13. omnes: the three parts mentioned above.

here of free and rapid motion in all directions, like that of the spider
in her web ε cf. Mart. viii 33, 15 discurrit aranea telo.
