284 AD HEL VJAM

16. quasdam : one famous instance was that of Octavia, sister
os Augustus, when she lost her son Marcellus: cf. Dial. vi 2, 4
nullum finem per omne uitae suae tempus standi gwnendz'que fecit;
ξ 5 lugubrem vestem non deposuit: her conduct is there contrasted at
length with the fortitude shown by Livia, when she lost her son,
Drusus.

inposita is unusual for sumptum but sumptam had been used
just before.

17. lugubria: seen. to 2 ξ 2.

uita—-fortior, ‘a lise that was hardier from the first’ than theirs :
Helvia was strictly brought up: cf. Quint. i 2, 6 infantiam statim
delicia? soluimus .· mollis illa educatio, quam indulgentiam (fondness)
natamus, neruos amnes mentis et [07217017'5 s}·alzg2't.

ξ 3. 20. saeculi, ‘of our time’: cf. 10 ἓ 8.

21. margaritae: Roman women prized pearls above other
jewels: cf. Pliny Nat. Hist. ix 106 principium columenque om-
nium rerum pretii malgaritae tenenl; xiii 91 mensarum insania,
quasfl’milme uiris conta-a malgarz'tas regerunt (i.e. women, when
attacked for extravagance in pearIS, retort by taunting meu with
extravagance in buying eostly tables).

2²2. tibi: for the dat. with mfirlserunt, cf. Polyb. 13 ξ 1.

²3· bene...1nstitutam: the nouerca (2 §4) appears to have
done her duty not so badly after all.

antiqua : see n. to Polyb. 3 ξ 5.

24. probiS‚ peiorum: both fem.

¹26. quasi exprobraret aetatem, ‘ as if it tauuted you with your
time of lise' : actas more often means ‘youth and beauty.⁷

27. quibus: dat. of agent: ‘who seek to charm by beauty
alone,' not by mores as well.

28. indecens, ‘unsightly'2 this word, necessarily excluded
from all daetylic verse, is common enough in the iambic metres
of Martial, as well as in prose.

ξ 4. 29. lenociniis, ‘a1·tificialcha1·1ns‚’ such as creta, cerussa,
and other cosmetics.
