priuatum apparently refers to the fate of Drusus himself, but
it serves mainly as an antithesis to publicum.

1 1. Ι suspect that puero has dropped out aster contigisse: the
omission would be likely to happen owing to the repeated word,
and the statement surely gains much in point by the insertion.

1 α. seditiosus, ‘ sactious.’

foro here refers to the rostra, not to the law-courts: cs. Lucan
iv 799 (to Curio) quid nunc rostra tibi prosunt turbata forumque, Ι
unde tribunicia plebeius szgrnifer arce Ι arma dabas populis? The
rostra formed the arx tribunicia, the stronghold of the tribunes'
despotic power; and Drusus, like Curio, turbabat forum, when
he addressed contiones in support of his laws.

disputatur, an: as there is no expressed alternative, Cicero
would use num or -ηέε but this use of an is common in all silver-
age writers.

14. aliquozmultz's.

15. tempestiua: because prolonged lise would have meant
certain failure in his enterprise.

Velleius paterculus, our chiefauthority for the history of Drusus,
takes a different and much more favourable view of his character.
He was apparently what we might call a Tory democrat. ‘ That he
was a sincere and unselfish patriot is beyond doubt ⁹ Heitland ἓ 835.

§³ superuacuum: superuacaneum is Cicero’s form of this
word.

18. perosi, ‘when they expressed their loathing sor...' 1 odim
osten denotes not merely the feeling but the expression of it: so
mirabuntur 3 ἓ 1 : see n. to Juv. 7, 35.

actum annorum, ‘action of their lives': cf. Quint. xi 1, 47 z'n
ceteris aclibus uitae: the first noun is not used by Cicero, except sor
the ‘act' osa play.

πο. eruperunt: ind. of repeated action, regular after cum
:quotz'ffi

adfectus, ‘their feelings ’ : see n. to 1 ἓ 1.

ξιξ. 22. uestra: Sen. now turns to address men in general.
The transition from his examples is strangely abrupt, and the con-
nexion with 3 §2 is not made clear: perhaps the abruptness is
oratorical ; but he seems unskilful, especially in this treatise‚ in the
art os passing from one point to another.
