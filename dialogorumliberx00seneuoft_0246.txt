ξ 1. 1. adiciamus ad has querellas...ind01em: cf. Helu. 15§2:
indolem inferstham is the direct object of the verb.

indolem, ‘promise’z the word is properly used of the young
animal or plant, not of anything inanin'nate; it suggests growth and
development, not maturity.

3. dignus fuit cet. z Ι have marked what follows here with
inverted commas, as I take it to be another formal remonstrance
addressed to Fortune, which breaks off at l. 16.

5. redditur illi, ‘ is borne to his character.'

aequale, ‘ unvarying.'

6. in tuum honorem, ‘ in compliment to you' : for this use of
in, see n. to Paul. 1 ξι : elsewhere (Paul. 19 ἓ 3) Sen. is severe on
those who love at another’s bidding.

§2- 7. quod non libenter adgnoscens, ‘which you did not
gladly 1⁴ecog1iise‚⁷ i.e. as like yourself: cs. Dz'al. vii 23, 2 quod
quisque agnouerit, zallas (let everyone carry off what he recognises
as his).

8. bono, ‘ good‚’ but bonUS‚ ‘kind’ : so bonitas, Paul. 13 ἓ 6:
there is a play on the two senses of the word.

9. pietas, ‘ natural affecti0n.'

nacta materiam: cf. Helu. 6 ξ 2.

11. iniuria, ‘ by suffering wrong' : noun, not adv.

numquam—minatus est, ‘he never used your relationship to
him as a threat against any man' : i.e. he never said, when he was
angry, ‘ I will tell my big brother, and then you will catch it Σ ’ The
use of lest-almvm sor the danger threatened is bold ε tuam fratrem
uindicantis iram would he simpler but too long for Sen.
