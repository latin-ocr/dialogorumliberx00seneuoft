ἕ 2. 1. nullus is used sor nemo: cf. Plaut. Bacch. 1903 Suet.
Cal. 35: but it is very rare in the interval between these writers:
Summers (p. lx) quotes an instance from Sen. Epp. 7, 11 : there is
perhaps another in De Clem. i 8, 2. The use is much commoner in the
oblique cases : in the Dialogues, Sen. has nullius:memsuis at least
twice, nullo at least three times, and nulli at least seven times.
For mellum:neminem, which is rare. cf. De Clem. i 3, 3: Epp.
108, 9 (this is a quotation).

Sen- seldom has nemini: in the Lenem, Ι have noted one
instance (55, 5) against ¹7 at least os nulli.

adloquendi, ‘of condolence⁷ : this word is often )( gratulari:
cf. Epp. 121, 4 cum...ex gralulasz'om’ nalum sit, quicquid adloquimm·
(i.e. all the sorrows for which we offer condolence arise from events
on which we offer congratulation); 98, 9 itt epistula, qua sororem
amisso filio adloquz'tur3 Val. Max. ii 7, 6 urbs, incerta gratulandi
prius an adloquendi ffcz'o ficngeresm'. For adlocutl'o in this sense,
see n. to Helu. 1 ξ 3.

2. occupauerit, ‘ can assume ’ : see 11. to 5 ξ 1.

aliudz‘special': except in this emphatic position, the word
could hardly bear this meaning.

4. contundet, ⁴ will annihilate‚’ lit. ⁴ smash up ² : cf. Paul. 10 ἓ 1.

hunc itaque cet. : had Sen. really believed that Claudius gave
Polybius a formal lecture of this kind, surely it would have been
rash to imitate the divine utterance.

5. te...desumpsit., ‘ picked you out': ef. Epp. 51, 1 (of Baiae)
locum illum sihi celebrandzmz luxmv'r‘i desumpsit.

8. aliquazalz'cuz‘us.

comploratione: for the verb, cf. 1 ἓ ²st

9.¹ fastus, ‘the Calendar,' the record of office, esp. of the con-

sulship. The common form is fasti, fastorum; but fastus, jizstuum
is occasionally found: cf. Dz'al. iii 21, 3 uno nomine occupare
fastus uult; and metre confirms the form in Lucan x 187 (Caesar

speaking) nec meus Eudoxi uincetur fastibus annus.
ξ 3. 11. imagines, the portrait-masks of ancestors displayed in
the atrium of a noble.
