aeger: Sen. osten mentions his weak health in his Letters, which
were written late in life : he says that he had experienced every kind
osbad health (Epp. 54, 1) ; in particular he mentions asthma (ibid.);
sainting-fits (77, 9); chronic catarrh, which made him anxious to
put an end to his lise (78, 1); and sever (104, 1). Metaphors and
similes from medicine abound in his writings.

indulgentia is personified, and the form of the sentence in which
clementia is personifled Polyb. 13 32, I take indulgentia here as
nom. and msa-umidam as antecedent to the relative clause z if abl.⁷
it would suit the grammar as well. .
