out of the publicity which a senator could not avoid. But by a
regular conventior) Romans of all dates speak of the quies and otium
of the equestrian career z cs. Cic. Καί). Ρωςί. 17 (said by the equites)
hanc ailam quietam atque odiosam secuti sumus, quae quoniam honore
caret, careat etiam molestia3 Pliny Epp. i 14, 5 equestris ordinis
princeps...honestam quietem hm'c nostrae ambitioni dscam an dzgnz'·

¹26. adfectus, ‘feelings.’

in hoc: cf. Polyb. ¹4 ξ 5.

1. in te: either ‘ in your case ’2 or, if te is aco, in fe iz used
for collatis z'n se : cf. Lucan i 1 bella per Emathios.. ,campos (i.e. gesta
per E. (κ). The second explanation is inore probable.

τι. unius, i.e. mei.

desiderium, ‘the blank ’ due to the loss of one.

3. praeter numerum: i.e. you have now only two sons, not
three, to love you ; but the two will do all that three could do: cf.
Dial. vi 4, 2 (of Livia after the death of Drusus) Tffierium, cuins
pietas efficiebat, ut nihil sibi nisi numerum deesse sentiret.

ξ 4. 4. nepotes, the children of her sons: two are mentioned ;
three (or four) had died shortly before (2 ἓ 5). ”

Marcum: generally supposed to be a son of the writer: but
I believe this to be Lucan, the 5011 of Mela : see Introd. p. li.

Alarcum cet. should be followed by Nouatillam, also in apposition
with nepotes ; but Sen. says so much of Marcus that he has 10 alter,
the normal arrangement.

5. blandissimum, ‘most charming’: often used of children,
in the sense of ‘ caressing,' ⁶ coaxing': cf. Mart. vi 29, 5 quis
blandior illo .?
