NOTES (c. 19 ᾗ 3) 167

ἓ 3 is unsuited to the place it occupies3 sor it is not specially
true of the occupatio of Paulinus3 and a reference to any other
occupatio, in the course of this personal appeal, is very inartistic. It
would, Ι think, come better at the beginning of c. 7.

ἓ 3. 28. ad...dormiunt, ‘regulate their sleep by...' : this and
what follows is true of the salutator and deductor, but not of the
praefectus annonae: therefore it is irrelevant here.

29. amare et. odisse...iubentur‚ ‘love and hate to order’: the
two infinitives are cognate accusatives, and res follows in appo-
sition.

30. liberi-imas, ‘most impatient of dictation ' : cf. Pliny Paneg.
85 neque enim, ut alia subiectis, ita amor imperatur, neque est ullus
adfi’ctus tam erectus et liber et dominationis impatiens.

For iubentur, cf. Tac. Ann. xii 3, 3 (of Claudius) principis, cui
non z'udz'cizmt, non odium erat, nisi indita el iussa.

1. ipsorum : sua cannot be used here, because it has to follow
in a different sense.

XX

Do not be envz'ous os lzz‘glz magistrates ον great orators. Such a
career, even if succesifith does not salty& ; and the death of
suclz men llas nothing noble in z't. Turannius at 90 felt retire-
ment from his post as if z‘t were death. But men ought to give
themselves some breatlzing-tz'me before their busy lise ends.

§L 3. uideris, inuideris: the play on words is no doubt
intentional.

praetextam : the robe of office ε Sen. refers to repeated consul-
ships : cf. De Ben. iii 33, 2 3 Epp. 104, 9 male te habebit ille consul
factus, ille etiam refectus (re-elected) z under Trajan, a third consul-
ship was the summit of distinction sor a subject : cf. Pliny Paneg. 61
fin. des quam plurimis tertios consulatus.

4. in foro, ‘in the law courts': under the empire, eloquence,
banished froin the Senate and the rostra, was to be heard only in
the courts.
