11. horrea: the granaries at Puteoli and Ostia, where the
grain, brought mainly from Egypt and Africa, was stored: cf.
Epp. 77, 13 Cic. De Fz'n. ii 84.

12. concalescat: (lamp grain is apt to be spoilt by ‘ heating' ε
Pliny uses both concalescere and confervescere in this sense, of wheat ⁸
(Nat. Hz'st. xviii 302 and 304) : this would be caused by neglegentia.

13. respondeat, ‘it may tally’: if the cai-go is less than the
invoice‚ there issrazcs on the part of the importers.

haec, ‘these studies.'

14. sciturus : ‘ which will teach you ³ is an equivalent.

quae materia sit dei cet. z what follows describes one of the
three divisions of philosophy 2 ,cf. Epp. 89, 9 philosophiae tres partes
esse dixerunt ct maximi et plurimi auctores: moralem, naturalem,
rationalem (ethics, physics, logie). Physics ( pars naturalis) com-
prises three subjects: (1) deorum natura; (2) animi mmmm
(3) mundi natura: in this order Sen. takes them.

materia: according to the Stoics‚ the substance of which the
gods are rnade, was fire.

uoluptas: this word, in relation to the gods and especially to
the Stoic gods, is surprising, in view of the contempt always
expressed by the Stoics for ἡδονή, the chief good of their great
antagonists‚ the Epicureans: nor can Ι think that uoluptas here is
justified by delectet se in Helu. 6 ξ 8. Hence there is some ground
for preserring uoluntas, the reading of the inferior mss.

15. condicio, ‘law of existence ’ : not far from ‘environment.⁷

forma, ‘shape': the Stoic gods were round τ „cf. Epp. 113, ἠ
sz' rotundam illis figuram, qualem deo, dederint; Cic. De Nat.
Deor. i 24 admirabor eorum tarditatem, qni animantem immortalem
et eundem beatum rotundum esse uelint: the Epicurean gods were
of human shape (l.l. ἓ 46).

casus=new experience: the Stoics denied chance.

16. ubi=in quo loco. nos, i.e. our souls.

17. componat, ‘lays to rest': the word would not suit the
Epicurean philosophy, which taught that Nature resolves our souls
like our bodies, into atonis. But according to the Stoics‚ the part
of the sky near the earth was a kind of Purgatory, from which the
soul ascended to the Paradise of aether: see n. to Polyb. 9 ἓ 8.

quid sit, ‘ what the power is....'
