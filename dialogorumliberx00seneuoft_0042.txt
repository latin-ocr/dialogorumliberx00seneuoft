the death of a son which took place twenty days before
the blow of his banishment fell¹. It seems most likely
that they were divorced; if 5116 had died, he would
hardly have omitted to state this when summing up his
misfortunes. The devoted wife of his old age, Paulina,
has already been spoken of 2. There is 0116 other person,
whom we know to have been with Seneca ; but he is not
mentioned here. We are told by Martial³ that Caesonius
Maximus, an intimate friend, followed Seneca into exile;
but Seneca does not, in either treatise, mention his name
or that of any other companion. For all that we could
gather from his words, 116 might have been as solitary as
Robinson Crusoe.

‘ This dismal unfortunate island, which Ι called the
Island of Despair ’—such is the entry in Robinson’s
diary 101· September 30, 1659; and Seneca gives nearly
as sad an account of his island. Corsica is a barren rock ;
the climate is pestilential‚ the soil unfruitful ; trees will

i.e. his dead wife had provided in her will for the maintenanee
01 1161 favourite. ⁷

³ Mart. vii 44, 10 ; 45, 1—4. Friedlander here is, I think,
unduly sceptical. The letters, of which Martial speaks as
addressed by Seneca to Caesonius, were clearly extant
then.
