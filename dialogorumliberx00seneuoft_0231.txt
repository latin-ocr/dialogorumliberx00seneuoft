officials would be aware of the shortage; Claudius, immediately
after his accession, took steps to meet the danger (Furneaux Tacitus
ii p. 25).

41 A.D. For other Caesars of the same name, cf. Polyb. 15 §.ff

23. octo dierum: in 51 A.D. there was only a supply of corn
for 15 days at Rome (Tac. Ann. xii 43, 3), ancl in 69 A.D. only
enough for 10 days (ffi'sl. iv 52): in each case the position was
thought alarming.

cibaria ε for the system of distributing corn gratuitously at Rome,
see nn. to Juv. 7, 174 and 10, 81.

24. dum, as often, has a causal sense.

Dio (lix 17) says that the scarcity at Rome was caused by the
lack of ships to import corn, Caligula having seized every available
vessel to make his bridge. This bridge, built, according to Seu„
to outdo Xerxes, was 3} miles long, stretching across the sea from
Baiae to the pier of Puteoli 3 a regular road was constructed on the
top of it (Suet. Cal. 19). It was built in 39 A.D.; Caligula was
assassinated at least a year later. So the events did not follow each
other as closely as Sen. implies.

pontes nauibus iungit, ‘ made a bridge of ships ' : the common
Latin idiom: what is really ‘joined' is not the bridge but the land
at each end of the bridge. So we say ‘to mix grog‚' when we mean
‘to mix wine and water so as to make ἕως]

uiribus imperil: i.e. the ships, and the soldiers who did the
construction.
