13. hauriendum belongs to the simile: in English something
must be supplied : ‘as you must drink quickly...‚ so you must use
time quickly.’ Itis common in Latin to mix up the simile with the
object which it illustrates: cf. rumpebatur 4 ξ 6.

§a pulcherrime: sc. dicit Vergilius.

14. infinitam cogitationem : it has been proposed to read agi-
tationem or cunctationem, but this reading is supported by cogitationes
in longum ordinant above.

16. in tanta temporum fugazcum tam cito tempora ficgz'ant t
all Latin writers use in with this idiomatic sense : cf. Polyb.

non sentiebant, ‘they never noticed': cf. Juv. 9, 129 obrepit

ξ 5. ²5· lectio : Romans often used journeys as an opportunity
for study: cf. Mart. i 2, 1 qm· tecum cupis esse meos ubicumque
libellos, Ι et comites longae quaeris habere uiae; xiv 188 si comes
ista tibi fuerit membrana, putato Ι carpere te longas cum Cicerone
uias. Julius Caesar wrote his work on Grammar and a poem (called
Iler) while travelling to join his army.

26. cogitatio, ⁶ meditation ’ 3 different from cogitatio above.

decipit, ‘beguiles.’ The less studious traveller could comfort
himself by counting the milestones: cf. Quint. iv 5, nsacz'entibus
iter multum detrabunt filligatz'onz's notata inscriptis lapidibus
spatia.
