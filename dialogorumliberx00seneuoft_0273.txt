This is, 50 to speak, the business part of the treatise. Sen. has
his own ‘axe to grind.’

ἕ 1. 15, 16. hoc, isto refer to the same person: for the change
of pronouns, see 11. 10 12 ἓ 1. iste would not be used here, had it
not lost the disparaging 561156 which it often bears in Classical
Latin.

16. nisi ea parte qua prodes, ‘except in that part (of your
activity). in which you do good‚' i.e. except for good: cf. 12 ξ 2 ;
Epp. 121, 14 ea parde sibi carus est homo, qua lzomo est.

18. adfecto, ‘ in evil case ³ z see 11. 10 5 ἓ 4.

prioris principis: Gaius or Caligula: it seems that he was
really mad ι cf. Suet. Cal. 50 mentis ualetudinem et ipse senserat ac
subinde de secessu deque plagando cerebro cogitauit.

19. Suum locum, ‘its right place.'

20. Sidus hoc 661. ἐ 11115 sentence was probably known to the
writer of the preface to the English Bible. The likeness between
Claud’ius and James Ι 111 their weaknesses has often been pointed
out ; here 15 another point of resemblance, that both were compared
by contemporary writers to the rising sun.

22. Germaniam pacet : this may refer to the subj ugation of the
Chauci about this time by Q. sabinius Secundus (Furneaux, Tac.
Ann. ii ρ. 32). The famous general, Corbulo, was active in
Germany till recalled by Claudius ; but this was not till 47 A.D.

Britanniam aperiat: the wish helps to fix the date of the
treatise: 566 Introd. p. xxv.

ξ 2. patrios triumphosztriumphs over Germany, as Drusus,
the father of Claudius, spent much of his life fighting in Gerlnany
and was the first Germanicus. He died near Maintz‚ 9 B.C.
