104 AD ΡΑ VLJNVM

conuersatio, very common in Sen., is neverzsermo: it means
‘society‚’ ‘intercourse’: cf. Helu. 7 §93 Dial. v 8, 1 sumuntur ιι
conuersantibus mores (a man gets his character from his company).
Cic. uses consuetudo in this sense.

{4- 4. in causa: for the phrase, cf. Helu. 7 ξ 8; Epp. 56, 8
quid in causa putas esse?

tanquam, ‘in the belief that...': cf. l. 9.

5. uobis...succurrit‚ ‘enters your heads‘: cf. Polyb. 18 ἓ 9:
occurro is more often used with the same meaning: cf. 10 ξ 1.

fragilitas: cf. Pliny Nat. Hz'st. vii 44 is demum profecto uitam
aequa lance pensz'tabz't qui semper frugi! [latis humanae memor suerit.

6. obseruatis, ‘take notice' z this verb is almost always active ε
in Pliny Epp. iv 30, 4 si diutius obientes, utrumque iterum ac tertio
uideas, there is no expressed object.

7. perditis, ‘you squander‚' tempus being understood as object.
The wise man dat, the foolish or over-rich man perdit: cf. Mart. iv
40, 7 iam donare potes, iam perdere (you are so very rich).

8. cum interim, ‘though all the while’: the subj. (sit) is
potential, ‘may be': the mood is not due to cnm z'nlerim. This
phrase is followed by pres. ind. Dz'al. i 1, 43 vi 11, 5; Epp. 1, 35
81, 31; 101, 6; 115, 17; Nat. Quaest. iprol. ἓ 14, ivpraeff.§ 11 ι
by fut. ind. Epp. 104, 11: by perf. ind. Dial. iv 33, 45 vi 1, 73
ix 12, 4. There is a single instance in Sen. (Dzal. iv 27, 2) where
the pres. subj.‚ not potential‚ follows cum interim. Valerius
Maximus uses it often and always with ind.

qui...donatur‚ ‘ which you make a present of.’

9. tamquam mortales, ‘in the belief that you will die': this
seems inconsistent with l. 5, but cf. 8 ἓ 2: it is certainly irrelevant.

10. concupiscitis: as your lise is limited, so your desire for
this world’s goods should be limited also.

ἓ 5. 11. plerosquezmultos: see n. to 2 ἐ 2.

quinquagesimo: see n. to 20 ἓ 4.

12. sexagesimus: for retirement froin active life at sixty,
cf. Juv. 14, 197 aquilam tibi sexagesimus annus Ι adserat.

13. officiis here has a wider meaning than in 2 ἓ 5: it would
include the work of a public office (cs. Polyb. 6 ἓ 4, Helu. 6 ἓ 2), or
business at the bar, often called qfficia cz'uzlz'a (see n. to Juv. 7, 106).

14. ista=y0ur course of lise.
