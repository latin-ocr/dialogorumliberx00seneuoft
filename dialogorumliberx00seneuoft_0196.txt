uellicationes effizgerit.

quotiens deploratus sum a meis, quotiens a medicis relictus! ; Pliny
Nat. Hist. vii 166 Pheraens lason deploratus a medicis uomicae
morbo, cum mortem in acie quaereret, uulnerato pectore medicinam

20. illis uacat respicere: uacat is often impers. and fol-
lowed by the pres. inf.: cf. ἓ 4 and Mart. x 58, 5 lecum celebrare

praeterita respicere: Martial may have had this passage in
mind, when he wrote of Antonius Primus in old age: x 23· 3
praeteritosque dies et tutos respicit annos, Ι nec metuit Lethes iam
propioris aquas. Ι nulla recordanti lux (day) est ingrata granisque, Ι
nulla subit, cm'zcs non meminisse uelit. Ι ampliat aetatis spatium sibi
uir bonus .· hoc est Ι uiuere bis, uita posse priore frui. For all
Martial's beautiful verses, one thinks that the destruction of
Cremona in 69 A.D., as well as some other incidents of his past life,
might have caused Antonius some qualms (Tac. Hist. ii 86; iii 15—33).

ξε. 22. exacta: silver-age writer³ osten use exigere rather
than agere with tempus, uitam etc.
