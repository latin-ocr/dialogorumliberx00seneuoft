between the earth and the moon, where storms rage; above it is
aether, the undisturbed element of the stars and the gods z with this
description of aer, comp. that of Ovid Met. i 54 (of the Creator) illic
(i-e. in acre) es nebulas, illic consistere nubes 1 iussit, el humanas
motura tonz'lrna mentes, Ι el cum fulminibus facientes frigora uentos.
l. 67 llaec super inposuit liquidum et grauitate carentem 1 aethera,
nec quicquam lerrenaefaecz's habentem.

28. hoc, ‘ this‚’ i.e. near us.

29. nimborum :pluuium

1. tumultuosum spatium: efss Dz'al. i 1, 3 where aer is called
tumultuosa pars rerum.

tum: ‘ finally.’

2. ad Summa, perrumpit: cf. Dz'al. v 6, 1 pars superior mundi
et ordinatior ac propinqua sideribus nec in nubem cogitur, nec in
tempestatem impellitur, nec uersolztr in lnrbz'nem .· omni tumultu
carel ,· inferiora ficlminantm‘.

3. diuinorum, ‘of divine things': by many of the Stoics the
gods were identified with the stars.

4. uaditz⁴1noves freely‚⁷ the regular meaning of the verb : so
the souL released by death, is said libere uagari (Polyb. 9§ 8) and
currere (Dz'al. vi 25, 1).

5. omnibus saeculis is strangely placed: it belongs, not to
uadit but to futurum esl: the soul, being immortal, has access to
all events both of past and future time: cf. Paul. 15 ἓ 5.
