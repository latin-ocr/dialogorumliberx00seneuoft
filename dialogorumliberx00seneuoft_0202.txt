fauillz's. Statius alludes to the legendary origin of Corinthian
bronze from the mixing of metals when the city was destroyed
by Mummius3 a burlesque version of this legend is put into the
mouth of Trimalchio (Petron. e. 50), who tells his guests that
Hannibal, when he took Troy, melted in one pile all the statues
of gold, silver, and bronze, and that Corinthia were made from
the fragments of this mass. Inscriptions show that collectors had
slaves (a Corinthiis) whose sole duty was to take charge of these
bronzes. Verres was proscribed (43 A-D.), and so lost his life at the
same time as his prosecutor Cicero, because os his Corinthia which
Antony coveted (Pliny Mzt. Hist. xxxiv 6).
