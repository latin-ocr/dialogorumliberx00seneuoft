10. milia: supply modim-nm.

12. frugalitatis exactae, ‘ of perfect respectability' ε cf. 20§ 3.
frugi is a word of compliment to a slave 01· freedman but not to
an ingenuus: cf. Cic. Ad Ast. vii 4, 1 frugi hominem ac, nc liher-
lz'nmn laudare uidear, plane uirum bonum.

13. tanto is osten used with a comparative in praise‚ eg. tanto
fortior! (Dz'al. ix 16, 3); but this is not in place here, where it seems

loquial phrase, for which cf. Helu. 2 ξ 5; Pliny Epp. iii 7, 11;
