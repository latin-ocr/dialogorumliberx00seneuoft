SENECA xlx·

(iii)
Seneca.

The main facts of Seneca's lite are well known,
and many of them have been referred to in the course
of this Introduction. As to his genius and his character,
there has been a remarkable difference oi opinion both
in ancient and in modern times. A tull examination of
the evidence would be worth making, but will not be
attempted here.

His fun name he happens to record in one ot liis
writings1: it was Lucius Annaeus Seneca. He was
born at Corduba about 5 Bc. and brought to Rome in
infancy. He was nursed through long illnesses by the
affectionate care of an aunt, and entered in due time on
the senatorial career as a quaestor 2. He became famous
as a speaker and as an author3. He was interested in
all branches of knowledge, and wrote, in youth, a work,
not now extant, on earthquakes⁴, as well as geographical
treatises on India and Egypt. We are told that the
emperor Gaius disliked him and would have taken his life,
had he not believed him doomed by physica] weakness
to an early death5. He survived Gaius however, but was
banished in 41 A.D. the first year of the reign of Claudius.
In 49 Ab, he was recalled by the influence of Agrippina,

(of his writings) : this is in 49 ΑΛ). : how much he had written

at that date, is uncertain.

uolumen ediderim iuuenis.

triumph in the senate-house. Seneca never loses an oppor-
tunity to attack Gaius.
