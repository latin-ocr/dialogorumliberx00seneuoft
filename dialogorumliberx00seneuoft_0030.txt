was afterwards put to death by her contrivancel ; if this
was so, Polybius was dead before October, 48 A.D., the
date of Messalina's death. In any case, he certainly died
before Claudius, who ceased inter hormines marari, as his
successor chose to pronounce it 2, on October 13, 54 A.D. ;
for Seneca himself, in the satire known as A pocolocyntosis‚
written immediately after the death of Claudius, represents
him as finding Polybius in Hades together with other
freedmen, whom the monarch had sent there ahead of
himself, that he might not lack attendance in the other
wor1d³.

His name shows that Polybius was either a Greek
or an oriental. His birth-place is unknown. He was
married and had a son living. Some of these freedmen
married Roman ladies of good family4 ; but we are not
told the name of the wife of Polybius. He was one of at
least four brothers; and it appears that they were all
domiciled at Rome. The others had left their province,
we may presume, to suck some advantage out of their
brother’s preferment. The death of one of these brothers
is the ostensible occasion of the treatise. They belonged,
if we may trust Seneca, to a family in which literature
was honoured; and Polybius was himself an author,

1 Dio Cass. IX 31, ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸν Πολύβιον, καίτοι καὶ ἐκείνῳ
πλησιάζουσα, καὶ διέβαλε καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν, οὐκέτι ἐπίστευον αὐτῇ (οἱ
Καισαρεΐοι).

² Suet. Nero 33: m5rari=to play the fool.

³ Sen. Apocol. 13 § 5 ad Messalinam cito rumor percrebuit
Claudiurn uenisse. commolunt primi omnium liberti, Polybius,
Myron, Harpocras, illwzphaeus, Plzeroriactes, quos Claudius

4 Thus Claudius Etruscus, an imperial freedman‚ married

the sister of the consul who commanded in the first Dacian
war (86 A.D.): Stat. Silani 3, 115. The case of the ‘husband
of three queens ' was exceptional.
