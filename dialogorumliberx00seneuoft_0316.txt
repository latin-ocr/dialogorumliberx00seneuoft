248 AD HEL VJAM

19. in oculos se ingerit, ‘ forces itsels upon the sight‚' ‘cannot
escape notice’: cf. Dias. iii 18, 2 etiamsi ingeritur oculis ueritas,
amat et luetur erroreum Nat. Quaest. vii 25, 5 latrum quinque
stellarum (the planets) quac se ingerunt nohis, quae alio atque alio
occurrentes loco curiosos nos esse cogunt.

21. uetustas, ‘ antiquity': see n. to Paul. 15 ξ 4.

22. Phocide : the people of Massilia did not come from Phocis
in Greece, but from Phocaea in Asia Minor. Lucan repeats his
uncle’s error: iii 340 post translatas exustae Phocidos arces l moeni-
bus exiguis alieno in litore luli3 v 53 lllassl'liaeque suae donatur libera
Phocis (where Phocis in Greece is wroneg connected with Massilia).

For the fact, cf. Herod. i 165 foll. He tells that the Phocaeans
sank iron in the sea and swore never to return to their country till
the iron carne to the surface. They then set out for Cyrnus (Corsica),
but halfof them repented and went back; those who went on, lived
in Corsica for five years, and then left it in consequence of the
attacks of the Carthaginians and Etruscans. Sen. appears not to
know or to disbelieve the reasons assigned by Herodotus for their
departure from Corsica.

25. inportuosi: cf. Pliny E pp. vi 31 , 17 per longissimum spatium
litus importuosmn ε Corsica is not really ill-provided with harbours.

26. in causa: cf. Paul. 3 ξ 3; Epp. 116, 8 nolle z'n causa est,
non posse praetenditur (the reason is want of will, the excuse is want
of power).

28. Galliae populis : cs. Cic. Pro Flacco 6 3 (in a fine panegyric
on Massilia) cum z'n ultimis lerrz's cincla Gallorum gentibus bar-
bariae fluctz'bus adlualur.

§9. transierunt, διέβησαν, ‘crossed the sea: ’ the Ligurians
were the inhabitants of what is now called the Riviera and the
Maritime Alps.

30. ritus, ‘ of their customs ': i.e. the present inhabitants
resemble Spaniards in some part of their dress and language: for
this meaning of ritus (which Gertz denies), cf. Val. Max. ii 2, 3,
where patrius ritus=lingua Latina.

tegmenta, sc. sunt Corsis. The Cantabri were a people of
Hispania Tarraconensis.
