3. libelli, ‘petitions' z see Introd. p. xxx.

rerum...congestus‚ ‘ a pile of documents.'

4. per ordinem suum, ‘ in their right order)

5. ammo perhaps implies, what is probable in itself‚ that the
emperor did not read the libelli when arranged; if he did, oculis
would be more appropriate.

exigendus est, ‘ must be caresully considered' z this is an exten-
sion of one sense of exegere, ‘to weigh‚' ‘to measure‚' by some
standard. dzgerendns (so Gertz) is a better word here, as it suits
congestus better.

7. misericordiam: see n. to clementia 13 ξ 2.

8. lacrimas siccare seems to have dropped out because of
lacrimae following. Α

ξ 1. 10. haec, ‘these thoughts.' points baekwards, not forwards.

tamen, in spite of its place, belongs to adiuuabant: fully
expressed‚ the sentence would run, quamquam lenioribus te remediis
adiuuabant, tamen adz'uuabunl: cf. Ovid Fasli i'i 31 1 aurea pellebant
tepidos umbracula soles, Ι qnae lamen Herculeae sustinuere manus,
i.e. quamquam Herculeae manus erant, tamen umbracula sustine-
bant: see Housman on Juv. 6, 640.

etiamnunc, ‘so sar‚’ ‘up to a certain point': see n. to Paul.

adhuc is used exactly in this sense Dc Ben. vii 10, 3, et lamen
adhuc z'sta materiam aliquam habent (i.e. gold and silver are at least
tangible, so that desire ofthem is to a certain extent pardonable) ;
cf. Quint. vi prooem. ξ 11 sed llaec spes adhuc: illa maiora cet.

11. eum, ‘but when .. ' ε this is opposed to the previous clause.

omnium rerum, ‘ everything else'
