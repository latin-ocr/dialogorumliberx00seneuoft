inscription proves that he was consul suffectus in the
second half of the year 57². In the year 54 Nero
became emperor; and Seneca, together with Burrus,
the praefect of the praetorian guard, then became, and
continued to be, during the next eight years, his chief
adviser. He has been called ‘the one great Minister
under the Empire3'; but ancient evidence in support
of this estimate is hard to find. Tacitus, who is the
main authority ior this period⁴‚ is not ill-disposed to-
wards Seneca; and, if we accept his account, we may
indeed pity Seneca but we cannot admire him. That
he was an amiable man and wished to do right, no care-
ful reader of his writings can doubt; but there is as little
doubt of his weakness. He probably thought himself
justified in retaining his position on the ground that his
influence might put some restraint on Nero. How utter

based on ¹ the tone which marks the relations of the State to
Paul throughout the period described in Acts.' But to trace
all this to Seneca is a long step.

⁴¹ The chief passages are Ann. xii 8; xiii 2, 13, 18, 20,
42; xiv 1, 7, 11, 53; xv 45, 60: the writer’s attitude is ·
strikingly impartial. Dion Cassius is almost everywhere de—

cidedly hostile.
5 It appears that Nero eventually confiscated Seneca’s

property. For papyri of 158 A.D. include -γῆ Σενεκιαιὶή in
the imperial domain in Egypt. Seneca alludes to his property
there (Epp. 77, 3J: see Hirschfeld Kleine Schriften p. 555.
