xii INTRODUCTJON

to seek in the letters of Seneca. Occasionally he men-
tions the season of the year or the place from which he
writes ; but, throughout the whole correspondence, allu—
sions to public events are very rare; and he hardly ever
refers to a contemporary incident that can be dated.
There is one apparent exception to this fule, Moralising
on the destruction of Lugudunum (Lyons) by sire, he adds
that it was burnt down'just a hundred years after the
colony was founded 1* As the date of the foundation is
known to have been 43 Bc, this letter appears to have
been written in 58 A.D. But it is now believed, mainly
on the evidence of Tacitus (A nn. xvi 13, 5), that Lugu—
dunum was not burnt down before the beginning of
65 A.D. Either Seneca has been misled by his love of
a round number, or the word septimus has dropped out
of the text after centesimus? But this seems to be the
single reference in the letters to a contemporary event
of ascertainable date.

The dialogues also have few indications of time; the
De Breuitate Vitae, however, contains two statements,
from which inferences as to its date can be drawn.

(1) It is clear from chapter 13 ξ 8 that, when these
words were written, the Roman pomerium had not been
extended so as to include the Aventine Hill. But we
know from Tacitus³ and Aulus Gellius4 that Claudius,
after his conquest of Britain, extended the pomerium

annus est. Lugudunum is described as one of the chief sights
of Gaul: it was the birthplace of Claudius.
