WRJTJNGS OF POL VBIVS xxiii

though, but sor Seneca, we should be ignorant ot the faet1.
Of his official duties more will be said below. But his
leisure hours were given to literary composition of two
kinds. His graver occupation was to translate Homer
into Latin and Virgil into Greek, both versions being
apparently in prose. What these productions were
really like, we have no means of knowing ; but we are
assured by Seneca that all the charm of each original
was preserved by the skill of the translator. His work
in lighter vein was to compose {ables in the manner of
Aesop; and in this department he is hailed by Seneca
as a pioneer among Latin writers. But he had at least
one predecessor; for Phaedrus published his well-
known {ables of the same kind in the reign of Tiberius.
It has been suggested2 that, owing to his enforced absence
in Corsica, Seneca had not yet heard of the fables of
Phaedrus. But this is improbable. Tiberius died in
March, 37 A.D., four years before the exile of Seneca
began ; and, even if the {ables were unknown as late as
41 A.D., Seneca was likely to hear very quickly of any
literary novelty³. It is far more likely that Seneca
wilfully ignores Phaedrus, in order to pay an undeserved
compliment to Polybius.

We are bound to be suspicions of the praise which
Seneca lavishes on the genius and character of Polybius.
For it is clear enough that his real motive for writing
was his desire to be recalled from banishment. Claudius
was notorious for subservience to his freedmen4; and

Pliny sometimes refers in his Natural History, is the same
person: the subjects are unsuitable.
