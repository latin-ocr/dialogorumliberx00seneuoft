112 AD ΡΑ VLINVM

sapiens is used by him in a looser sense also, to denote those who
lead a moral lise on philosophical principles.

The introduction os the sapiens is somewhat irrelevant here.

procedet must be a compound of cadere: praefidet is unsuitable
here3 and the best mss. of Latin authors offer forms like accedere,
rccejzn'l etc.⁷ where a of the simple verb becomes e, not z', in the
compound: cf. Helu. 10 §3 where A has recepit for recipit: see
Munro on Luer. ii 1025 (notes 1).

23. integrae, ⁴ complete’ : i.e. there is no halfness about it.

libertatis: gen. os description.

sentiae, ‘stable'z lit. ⁴ with no hollow or holes in it’: often
applied to uoluptas (Helu. 5 ἕ 5), pax, felicitas etc.

24. sui iuris, ⁶ his own master‚' ‘independent ': used as an
adj. even in the poets ε eg. Lucan viii 659 iam Cornelia non cstl
iuris, lllagne, sui: see n. to precario, Polyb. 11 ἓ 1.

25. supra. fortunam: the smiles and the srowns of Fortune
alike he treads under foot.

ln Livius Drusus we have another aelim politicz'an, whose public
career, bcgun in early youth, became a burden even to himself.
His death, whether suicide or not, was the only issue from a
hopeless situation.

No length of life can satisfit those whose lives are careless and vicinus.

In 91 B.C. M. Livius Drusus, being tribune, carried an agrarian
law and a corn law: the senate thereupon declared his laws null
and void ε on his return from the senate-house he was struck down
by an unknown assassin.

ἓ 1. 26. cum leges—mouisset, ‘ when he had proposed revolu-
tionary laws and revived the evil policy of the Gracchi 't the verb
applies in one sense to leges and in another to mala.

Cf. Dz'al. vi 16, 4 Cornelia Liui Drusi clarissimum iuuenem
inlustris ingenii, uadentem per Gracchana uestz‘gy'a, inperfectis tot
rqqatz'onibus, intra penales interemptum snos, amiserat incerto caedis
auclore. His legislation followed the lines laid down by the
Gracchi3 but we have little certain knowledge of his motives and
measures.
