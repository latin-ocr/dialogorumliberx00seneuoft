JNTERPOLA TED MSS. lvii

solandum: and he also omitted se: so that his sentence
begins with illa consolareo philosopho. In other mss. the
second word appears in at least five different forms,
which are all stupid attempts to correct the original
error: consulareo, consulares, consulam, consilium, con-
solamen.

(ii) In De Vita Beata 25 ξ 4 Seneca wrote cum deus
undique consalutabor, ‘ when I shall be hailed on all sides
as 3 god.’ When the scribe 01 Α 631116 10 write the
verb, the Latin word consul came unseasonably into
his mind, and he wrote commu but, 31 11115 point, he
recalled 1115 wandering thoughts and wrote the whole
word 35 εοηεααίιιζαῦον. Now the process 01 corruption
begins. The scribe 01 Β, 1116 next best ms. 10 Α, was

, naturally puzzled by this verb: in order 10 make 1116

text look like Latin, adding another letter, he wrote
consualuctabor. This gave rise to 1116 following corrup-

tions, all based on Β and all found in one or other 01
1116 mss. 2

1. cum deus undique conscientia luctabor.
2. cum deus utique et scientia luctabor.

3. cum deo utique conscientia luctabor.

4. cmm deo utique et consciam luctabor.
5. eum deo ubique conscia luctabor.

So much 101· 1116 progeny 01 Β. But ,the original error
01 Α produced another crop 01 interpolations, not des-
cended through B, so that other mss, give z

6. cum hiis undique consultabor.
7. oum diis undique consultabo.

And, finally, two mss. carry the corruption still further ε
they suppress every 11366 01 1116 original error and coolly
offer us the following reading :

8. cum deus undique, quae sua sunt, requirat.
