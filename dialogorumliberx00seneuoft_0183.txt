NOTES (c. 6§4) 115

23. in artissimum contrahetur, ‘will shrink into a span 'z
the fut. means, ‘it will be found to do so': cf. Polyb. 11 ἕ 5;
Lucan i 31 Poenus erit ( = inuenietur esse).

²4· hoc...spatium‚ ‘ your actual period of lifes

25. natura: abl. currit, ‘hastens on ἐ the indic.is occasionally
used elsewhere by Sen. aster quamuis, e.g. De Ben. iii 32, 5.

dilatat =prolongs.

27. rei: dat. ε for the constr„ cf. Helu. 13 ἓ 2.

Of all men, wlzo misuse tlzez'r time, the worst are glutiens and
libertines. Allen waste lime in many ways. Their way qf
living z's α bar to the aequit-emant of knmoledge. T lze ανί os
life, wlziclz great metz slave sludied exclusz'vely sor α lese-lime, is
unattaz'nable by tlzem. lee philosopher finds li e long enough,
because lte lets none of it run through lais fingers. illany, wlto
waste their lives on other people‚ have times when tlzey rcalise their
solly. lee real length os life depemt's upon tlte use made osit.

The first paragraph of this chapter is out of place: neither
z'n primis nor et illos can be explained here, and istorum (ξ 2) has
nothing to refer to. If Sen. had spoken first of the occupati as
a class, and then of one form of occupatio, the present passage would
follow well enough, and istorum would refer to all occupati. Gertz
would transfer it to the beginning of c. 13, so as to follow the
question, quaeris fhrtasse‚ quos occupatos uocem :⁹ (12 ξ ι). Α better
remedy, Ι think, would be to prefix 19 ξ 3, out of place there, to
this chapter.

ἓ 1. 29. in primis=among the worst.

etis here meaningless—no other class of occupati having been
mentioned. ⁷

nulli rel nisi uino uacant, ‘give all their time to nothing but
wine ' ε uaco alicui rei has two meanings : (Ι) Ι have time for a thing3
(2) I give time to a thing: both meanings are seen in Mart. xi 1, 6
nec Musis uacat, aut suis uacaret (he has no time for poetry;
if he had, he would use it to write poetry of his own). The
second is the meaning here.
