saw his article, and I made no change afterwards
in what I had written. The substance of the fourth
section, which deals with the history of the text,
is taken from Madvig’s Adversaria Critica.

Upon my revision of the Text much time has
been spent. Here Gertz is the main authority,·
and Ι should have been spared some labour if Ι
had known earlier of the existence of his edition‚·
but the last Teubner editor misled me here (see p. lvii
and n. on p. 94). I have revised the punctuation
throughout and occasionally marked fresh paragraphs
where the sense requires it. The text of Seneca
is the happy hunting-ground of emenders: I have
accepted most of Madvig’s emendations and many
of Gertz's; and I have ventured to place some ot
my own in the text and to record others (see Index).
Most of Bentley’s emendations have been printed
already; but I have gleaned a few scraps from the
margin of his copy, an Elzevir of 1672, preserved in
the University Library. What Bentley said of Bishop
Pearson is as true of Bentley: “the very dust of his
writings is gold.'’

In the Commentary, my object has been to
explain, wherever a difficulty or doubt was possible,
the meaning of the Latin text as I understand it.
The ingenuities and fantasticalities of Seneca need
a good deal of explanation. For this purpose I
have studied, above all, the extant writings of Seneca.

either to defend the text or to explain it, by quoting
similar passages from other parts of his writings.
