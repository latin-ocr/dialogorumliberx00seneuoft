NOTES (c. 3 ξ 2) 179

12. modestiae : a regular term of praise for the imperial freed-
men, just as cim'litas is for similar qualities in the emperor himself.

14. onus, ⁶ what a responsibility you laid upon them ' ι Pliny is
fond of onus and onero in this sense : eg. Pancg. 73 onerasti
fitlm'ospm'ncipes (i.e. they will find it hard to live up to you).

ἓθ. [6. exemptus est: sc. felicitati.

parum autem cet. : there is surely something very mechanical
in this pumping up of a fresh set of reproaches against Fortune.

17. indignari denotes the expression of anger, not merely the
feeling of it z see n. to mirabuntur, Paul. 3 ξ 1.

18. paria uerba reperire: cf. Stat. Sila. v 5, 49 ahsmnptae
uires, et copia sandi} nulla milli, dtglmmqne m'lzil mens fulmine
tanto Ι repperit .· ῐ”]ι]ἱ’7ἰ”ιυ’ aar omnis el omnia sordmt ,Ι uerba.

etiamnunc, ‘ once again ² : see n. to Paul. 13 ἓ 3.

ξ 4. 23. cruenta-:crudeliz it does not imply that the brother
died a violent death: cf. Lucan iii 741 cruenlm...d0lor.

turbam : there were at least four brothers 2 turha is often used of
a small number : cf. Ovid Ales. i 554 (Deucalion speaking to Pyrrha)
terrarum...nos duo turba (the population) smnus; ibz'a'. vi 199 non
lamen ad nnmerum redigar spoliata duorum, Ι Latonae turbam (but
in this case the word may perhaps be ironical).

24. stipatam expresses what we should call the ⁴ solidarity’ of
the family : so Lucretius (i 610) denotes the composition of the
atom, in which the parts are inseparable, by this word.

25. turbare is rather awkwardly used, so soon aster larbam.

ἓ 5. 27. antiqua, ‘of the good old times‚⁷ ⁶ strict’ : cf. Paul.
10§ 1 3 Helu. 12 ξ 43 16 ξ 3 3 Dz'al. vi 1, 1 nisi scirem...morcs taos
uelut antiquum exemplar aspici.

1. in felicitatis cet-2 Ι have inserted in, because, although it
may be possible to explain potentini conseruata* abstinentia, it seems
to me that abstinentia must be nom„ in order to balance inno-
centia and frugalila& the other virtues of Polybius: summa will
then be nom. agreeing with abstinentia. The loss of z'n after nihil
is natural enough.

2. abstinentia is )( auaritia : see n. to Helu. 14 ξ 3.
