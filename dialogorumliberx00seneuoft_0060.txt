of his fatherl ; should we not expect to hear something
of the kind from Seneca ? Again, if Marcus lived on, why
is there no mention of him at the time when nearly every
member of his family was destroyed by Nero? If he
died, is it likely that Seneca never once, in the course of
his voluminous writings, alluded to the death of such a
darling child Ρ At a later time, he wrote more than one
letter of formal condolence; one of these is addressed
to a father, who had lost a young son 2. Not a word
is said there, or anywhere else, of the death of Marcus.

All these difficulties disappear‚ if we suppose that
Marcus was the poet Lucan. Marcus Annaeus Lucanus
was born at Corduba on Nov. 3, 39 A.D., and brought to
Rome when he was eight months old. He may have been
quite two years old, when Seneca was banished, and
between three and four, when the treatise to Helvia
was written. The language which Seneca uses is per-
fectly suited to a child of that age 3 and, from what we
know of Lucan, it would be strange, if he were not an
exceptionally precocious child.

But the strongest argument in favour of this identi-
fication is afforded by the eighth epigram of Seneca.
This runs as follows:

VOTVM

sic mihi sit frater maiorque minorque superstes
et de me doleat nil nisi morte mea;

sic illos uincam, sic uincar rursus, amando;
mutuus inter nos sic bene certet amor;

sic dulci Marcus qui nunc sermone fritinnit
facundo patruos prouocet ore duos.
