we get in this correspondence, we can form some idea
of the vast mass of documents which kept pouring in
from Rome, Italy, and every province of the empire, to
be laid before the ruler for his decision. The freedman
a libellis was really a ‘master of requests.’ The work
of his office must have been heavy indeedJ and we can
believe that Seneca is not far from the truth when he
says that Polybius, however much distressed he may
be by the loss of his brother, has no time to weep for
him.

The Roman aristocracy naturally resented the tenure
of these important offices by the imperial freedmen‚ and,
still more, the wealth and influence thus acquired. But
the system, which had grown up naturally and inevitably,
continued until the time of Hadrian. In his reign, the
chief offices of the household were taken out of the hands
of freedmen and entrusted to Roman knights.
