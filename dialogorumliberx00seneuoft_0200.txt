Epode 2 ; but Sen. means philosophie retirement, as the mention os
the sapiens (1. 18) shows.

12. quidni...sit, ‘ why should it not be‚⁷ i.e. ‘ of course it is’ ε
see n. to 7 ξ 7.

delegatur, ⁴ is transferred to another’ ε originally, 'this is a
technical term of finance, for which see Summers on Epp. 18, 14.

13. alio: adv.

lndezex illa: cf. 7 ξ 5.

16. in reditu est, ‘is a part of incorne,’ i.e. brings money in,
is well invested. Sen. seems, by his apology‚ to consider the
phrase technical: cf. Pliny Epp. iv 6, 1 solum milzi Laurentinum
meum z'n reditu.

17. quandoque:quandocumque: common in silver-age writers,
especially in Suetonius.

18. sapiens, ‘the philosopher,’ not here ‘the Sage' : see n. to

l apply the term ‘ engrossed’ not only to those whose life is spent in a
ceaseless round of business, bnt to those as well who spend their
leisw'e amiss. Such are llze dz'lettante z'n art and music, the
dandy who spends lzz's day in the lzaz'r-cutter’s clzaz‘r, tlte over-
anxious dinner-gz'ver. E ven the utterly indolem and ltelpless
cannot be said to etzjoy leisuge. Indolence is carried by some
men to suclz lengths tlzat one wonders it is not satirised on
tlte comis stage.

Iulia in the sorum, the chief civil court at Rome.

21. canes eiciunt : the dogs are let into the court at night-sau Ι
to act as guardians. Sen. does not mean that the dogs actually
evict the loiterers, but that the coming of the dogs is the signal for
these men to leave: cf. l. 233 Helu. 7 §45 Dial. ix 12, 6 unum
quemque ex lzz's...lux orta expellit (the dawn is the signal for them
to turn out of their houses).
