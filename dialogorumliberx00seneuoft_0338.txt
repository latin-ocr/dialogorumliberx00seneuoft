T ltat poverly is m) evil, is not α mere (logum of philosopham. Most
proplc arc poor, yet manage lo lm a! least as claeerful as tlcae rich.
lee ricla themselves have cm occasion to dispense willa their
luxuries ,· αἰ times {lacy make a plenum-e of doing without
tllem. some of ίΙιᾱ greatest men of old, poets andplzilosoplzers‚
were poor. Menenius Agrippa and Scipio left no sortnnes when
tltey died. ls tllcir example not good enough sor us ?

ξ 1. 25. ad eleuanda„ ‘ in order to make light of': cf. Polyb. 17 §4

26. nisi qui putat τ i.e. opinio, not natura, makes poverty hard
to bear: see 11. to cupiditati 10 ξ 11.

27. tantum praeceptis: 1 will give you exempla as well, to
prove my point: these follow.

28. pars pauperum : see 11. to multz'lmlinis, 6 ξ 4.

3* 2. transeamus opes paene inopeS‚ ‘let us pass over wealth
that is almost poverty‚' i.e. those who, without being pauperes,

This seems the most probahle correction of an uncertain text.

4. circumcisae sunt peregrinantium sarcinae, ⁶ the baggage

furniture’ in Bz‘slzop Blougram’s Apology‚ where the ‘jerorne‚ piano,
and bath ' are ce'rcmmz'sa by the ruthless agent.

7. militantes-——wohefkofivrez not οἱ πολεμοῦντες; the subject iS
dim'tes. To this general rule some exceptions are recorded, and one
concerns Paulinus, to whom Dial. X is perhaps addressed : cf. Pliny
