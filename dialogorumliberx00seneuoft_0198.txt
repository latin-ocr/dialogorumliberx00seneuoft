130 AD ΡΑ VLJNVM

sub iugo Ζ the comparison is to a horse or ox, whose neck is so
tightly harnessed that it can only look in one direction: there is no
allusion to missio sub iugum.

15. abit, in profundum, ⁴ vanishes in an abyss.' This suggests
another figure, that of the sieve into which the Danaids pour water
for ever: this sieve was often used by moralists as a type os insati-
able desire : cf. Sen. Epp. 99, 5 adquiescamus iis quae iam hausimus,
si modo non perforato animo hauriebamus et transmittente quidquid
acceperam Lucr. iii 936 pertusum uas3 Plato Gorg. 493, Β τετρη-
μένος πίθος.

16. nihil prodest z nihil is adv.

17. si non subest, ‘if there is no bottom.'

18—20. nihil...detur is parenthetical : sor a similar parenthesis,
cf. Dial. iii 21, 4: per quassos...transmittitur is the apodosis of
the conditional sentence.

Haase, perhaps rightly, punctuates: sic nihil rqfhrt‚...subsidat:
per quassos cet.

18. nihil refert, ‘it makes no difference 'z re'fert is commonly
used by silver·age writers, in prose as well as poetxy (where mette
often prescribes it), with the sense and constr. os interest.

detur, by Nature: cf. dati 1 ἓ 1.

19. non est ubi subsidat, ‘there is no place for it to settle
down at.'

foratus: the compound pmjfhratus is commoner, for which the
poets use pertusus as a metrical substitute : see n. to Juv. 5, 131.

²3· uenit is perfect tense.

ξ 6. ²4· mundus, ‘the firmament,⁷ whose unceasing revolution
causes the movement of the stars : cs. Polyb. 7 ξ 2 ; Ovid stlat. ii 7ο
adde quod adsidua rapitur uertigine caelum 1 sideraque alla trahit.

25. in eodem uestigio, ‘stationary’: sor this phrase, ef. Nat.
Quaest. vii 10, 3; Pliny Epp. vi 20, 8; Val. Max. viii 13 E 1;
Tae. Hekn ii 78 eodem uestigio. Yet Sen. admits that certain stars
near the Pole are stationary (Helu. 8 ἓ 6).

27. id ipsum, αὐτὸ τοῦτο, ‘ even this?

iuis ι dat. after subducitur.

28. districtis in multa must be taken together : the sense
shows this : for the constr.‚ cf. Helu. η ξ 1. The order of words
is not simple or natural, but quite possible in Sen.: cf. Helu. 18 ἓ 9.

subducitur, ‘is filched away!
