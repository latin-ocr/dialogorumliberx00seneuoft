office in 48 A.D.‚ when Claudius consulted him, as one of
his chief advisers, in the matter of Messalina's marriage
to Silius. It is hardly conceivable that a man, who was
over 90 before 41 ΑΒ. <the date of Gaius’ assassination)‚
should be holding this important office seven years later.
Thus there arises a difficulty, of which the most probable
solution is to suppose that Seneca has over—stated the
age of Turanniusl.

Be that as it may, it is certain that Turannius was
praefectus arzrzonae in October 48 A.D.‚ the date oi Messa-
lina's mad marriage to Silius ; and also certain that
Paulinus was praefectus when Seneca addressed him,
which was not after Jan. 24, 50 A.D. The treatise was
therefore written at some time between these two dates.

Gercke (Seneca-Studien p. 289) supposes Seneca to
have written the treatise during his exile in Corsica.
There is not a particle of evidence to support this view;
it is sar more likely, from Seneca's silence, that he had
been restored from exile before he wrote it. For not
one oi the works written after his restoration contains
any allusion to his banishment.

The treatise is a kind of sermon, which describes and

1 The praenomen given in Tac. Arm. i 7 is C.‚ i.e. Gaius.
In Seneca, Gertz, followed by Hermes (Teubner), reads
5. Turarmz'us. If this is right, there are two different persons.
But it is highly improbable that Seneca's anecdote does not
refer to the Turannius, whom we know to have been praefectus
annonae at least from 14 to 48 ΑΛ). It may be that Seneca
gave the wrong praenomen : it would not be the only case in
which he has done so: see Bibulus in Hermes' index.
