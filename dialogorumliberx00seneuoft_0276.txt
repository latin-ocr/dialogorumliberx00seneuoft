[fiel sure llml illc Emperor has already used llis uncqualled knowledge
ancl wisdom 2'72 order so console you. lvmgine tlzat lle speaks to
you, and reminds you, from ln's capacium memory, ‘qs great
Romans in pass history who have lzczd to mourn llzc’ loss of a
deardy-lovezl brother.

ξ 1. 23. publicum has the sense of commune : see n. to Paul.
Ι § 1.

24. aut· me omnia fallunt, autz‘if Ι am not entirely niis-
taken, then...': cf. Dz'al. ix 8, 4 aut egoj‘allor, aul cet. ; Epp. 79, 7
aut ego le non noui, aut cet.: the parenthetical insertion of the
phrase here is remarkable. A commoner phrase of similar meaning
is, si illum noui: cs. Heln. 19 ἓ 4.

iam, ⁶ before now ' is emphatic.

25. tam magno for tauto is believed to be colloquial Latin:
see Friedl. Cena Trz‘malclz. p. 208: but Sen. uses it here because
of the assonance with maiora: in general he likes to use lam multi,
quam mulli for lot, quot.

26. omni modo: as is shown by the sequel, condolence was
regularly compiled out of (Ι) exempla, (2) praecepta : cf. Dial. vi τε, 1
ssz'o a praeceptis inczjloere omnes, qui manere aliquem uolunt, in
e„r‘et›zpl2's desinere. Sen. says that Claudius will have exliatistefl
both means: in point of fact, Claudius, in his fictitious speech,
confines himself to exempla.

28. memoria, facundia: the first is so far true that Claudius
probably had stored in his memory a great deal of rather
useless knowledge3 but he was notorious sor lapses of memory:
Suet. Claud. 39 intercalent in eo mirali sunl homines et obliuionem
el incousize'eramiam‚ uel, ut Graece dicam, μετεωρίαιι et ἀβλεψίαν.
Oscz'sa Messalina, paulo postquam in triclinio decubuil, ‘cur dqmz'na
non uem'ret' requisiit. Α

To ‚facundia he had no claim: his matter was pedantic‚ and
his delivery was marred by a stammer: cf. Suet. Claud. 303 Sen.
Apocol. 11 ξ 3 (Augustus speaking of Claudius) {ria uerba cilo iungat
(if he can string three words together without pansing) et seruum
me (iuml.
