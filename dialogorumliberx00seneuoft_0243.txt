NOTES (c. 2 ξ 1) 175

est, Ι quae nunc pro domino (i.e. pro me ipso), pro uobis saepe locuta
est, Ι inuidia careat.

Seu. adopts a very different tone in writing to his mother ε see
Introd. p. xxxiii.

18. simodo: cf. Paul. 12 ἔῃ Helu. 16 ἓ 5 : common in Sen.:
classical Latin would have either sz'...est or modo...sit. So the
relative pron. is often followed by modo and ind.: cf. Helu. 1 1 ἓ 4.

ξ 2. 19. conqueramur, ‘let us lament together’: that this
is the meaning here, is proved by what follows.

atque adeo, ‘or rather’: especially common in the earlier
speeches of Cicero : e.g. Verr. ii 3, ¹4² nova lege atque adeo nulla
lege. In Latin generally, ac potius is commoner.

21. in eo homine, ‘ in the case of that human being.’

te continuisse, ‘ to have curbed your fury.'

22. munere tuo, ‘ thanks to you ' : like beneficio tuo : see n. to
Helu. 17 ἓ 4.

23. felicitas...inuidiam z the second is, as a rule, the shadow
of the first: cf. Mart. v 6, 5 (addressing an imperial favourite) et
sis Inuidia fauente felix (may you be prosperous and may Envy
smile on you in spite of it !).

24. ecce: ‘but now' : cf. Faul. 13 ξ 3.

saluo Caesare, ‘while Caesar lived': the use of saluus in the
sense of uiuus or superstes is constant in all silver-age writers. Only
the death of Claudius, says Seu„ could have touched Polybius still
more nearly.

26. circuisses: Pol. is compared to a besieged city, Fortune
to the enemy who makes a circuit of the walls, ‘to spy out weak
points : cf. Stat. Sz'lu. ii6, 68 gnara dolorum Ι Inuidia infelix animi
uitalia uidit Ι laedendique nias.

27. faceres, ‘ could you have done.'

ἓ 3. 28. im obnoxius ‘dependent on it ²: cf. Tac. Ann.
xvi 6, 1 amori uxoris obnoxius erat: the dat. after obnoxius in this
sense is generally of a bad thing, eg. obnoxius morbo, ‘liable to
disease’3 and the same is implied here.

1. quantum potest : i.e. he cannot always repel the emperor's
munificence.
