Ruskin writes, with a still closer resemblance to the
text of Seneca, which, however, he is less likely than
Macaulay to have known:

‘We may intrude ten minutes' talk on a cabinet
minister, answered probably with words worse than
silence, being deceptive ; or snatch‚ once or twice in our
lives, the privilege of throwing a bouquet in the path
of a Prinoess, or arresting the kind glance of a Queen.
And yet these momentary chances we covet, and spend
our years, and passions‚ and powers, in pursuit of little
more than these; while, meantime, there is a society
continually open to us, of people who will talk to us as
long as we like, whatever our rank or occupation ;
-talk to us in the best words they can choose, and with
thanks if we listen to them.. . ‚Will you go and gossip
with your housemaid, or your stable boy, when you may
talk With queens and kings ; or flatter yourselves that
it is with any worthy consciousness of your own claims
to respect that you jostle with the common crowd for
entre'e here, and audience there, when all the while this
eternal court is open to you, with its society wide as the
world, multitudinous as its days, the chosen‚ and the
mighty, of every place and time ? Into that you may
enter always ; in that you may take fellowship and rank
according to your wish; from that, once entered into it,
you can never be outcast but by your own fault¹.'

Neither Macaulay nor Ruskin would have chosen‚ as
Seneca does, philosophers only for this kind of companion-
ship ; but in their love of books the three writers are
at one.
