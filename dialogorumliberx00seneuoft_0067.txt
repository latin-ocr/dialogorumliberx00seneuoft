CRJTJCAL NOTES lix

That part of A which contained Dialogue xi (Ad
Polybium) has been torn out, and little more than the last
chapter is preserved. Here therefore the critic is forced
to rely on the inferior sources; and it is possible that
the text is in places too deeply corrupted for the truth
ever to be found out. The beginning of this Dialogue
has been entirely lost; and in many mss. and in the
early editions it is attached, as if it formed part of it, to
the preceding Dialogue (Ad Paulinum).

The critical notes subjoined to the present text have
been selected mainly from the apparatus criticus of
M. Cl. Gertz (Copenhagen‚ 1886). I had previously
used the text of Emil Hermes (Teubner, 1905), the value
of which is ilnpaired by some oversights: thus, while
mentioning papers and reviews by Gertz, he nowhere

“ ’ distinctly refers the reader to the edition of Gertz or to

his Critica Studia and again he uses some of Gertz's
critical symbols (Ο and C) without giving any explanation
of their meaning.

Where the reading of A has been departed from
(except in trifles), that reading is given, and the source of
the correction adopted is indicated. Where the text is
preserved in Α, other mss. are seldom referred to by

name. In Dialogue xi, where A fails us, references (also
taken from Gertz) are given to five or six of the less
interpolated of the inferior mss. Some conjectures,
chiefly by Gertz, which seemed highly probable without
being certain, are also quoted in the critical notes.
Discussion of the readings adopted is reserved for the

commentary.
