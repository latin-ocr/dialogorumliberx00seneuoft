174 AD POL YBIVM

cum omnibns, omnia mecum perire, misero, magno lamen mortalitatis

solario, credidissem.
7. sunt: sint would be more normal, as this is part of the

reflexion. ,
8. rerum natura is the same as natura above3 but the Romans

tend to use the longer form, when they make Nature either a con-
scious agent, as here, with a purpose in view, or a person who
speaks: for the latter, ef. Lucr. iii 9313 Mart. ix 41, 9.

10. aequalitas (the fact that it applies to all alike) also governs

fati.
