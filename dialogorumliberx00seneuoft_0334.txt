266 AD HEL VJAM

4. exilium, ⁴ place os exile’: cs. 9 ξ 3.

5- abunde fertile: yet we heard (9 ἓ 1) that Corsica was uix
ad tutelam incolenlimn fertilis, let alone exiles: it is hard for a
rhetorical writer to be consistent.

The exile must leave behind him his fine house and fine clothes ,· but
he will find what Nature needs, a rooffor his head ami α cover
for his nakedness. lf he sighsfor all the refinements of luxury,
you wouldfind it impossible to ιξναίίχῇι his insaliale desires, even
if you gave him. back all thot he once had. For it is the nature
of vz'cious desire, thal it never con have enough. The mind
is the source os true weallh ,· and {he mind despz'ses material
luxuries ‚· its wish is to escape from the prison of the body,

to soar lo its kindrecl sky. The mind is free from the troubles
and dangers which molest the body.

ξ 1. 6. desideraturus est, ‘is likely to miss’: the sense of
desiderabit below is different.

7. haec quoque ε Le. as well as food.

9. tegitur, ⁴ is sheltered and covered?

ξ 2. 1 1. sed desiderat: again ξ 3 z in both places the protasis
of a conditional sentence is disguised by the absence of si.

conchylio: the murex, a shell-fish, from which the purple dye
was got.

12. intextam auro cet. : cf. Pliny Nat. Hist. viii 196, aurum
intexere inuenit Attalus rex, unde nomen Attalicis. colores diuersos
picturae inlexere Babylon maxume celebrauil et nomen imposuz‘t;
Lucr. v 1427 at nos nil laedit ueste carere 1 pmpurea, alque auro
signisque ingentibus apta.

13. distinctam, ‘ spangled‚’ ‘dotted‚’ ‘ studded’: cf. Epp. 76,
14 uagina gemmis distinguitur: the word is appropriate, because
more than one eolour is used: thus the sea is insulis distinctum
(Dial. vi 18, 5), and the sky is stellis distinctum (Nat. Quaest.
vii 24, 3) but not sole divim-tum.

artibus apparently corresponds to signis of Lucr. , sextilibus sigillis
of val. Max. ix 1, 4, andzartistic figules.
