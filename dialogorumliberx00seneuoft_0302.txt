234 AD HEL VJAM

IV

l intend to confront your grief openly and conqner it. T o effect this,
l shall prove two points .· first, that my condition z's not properly
lo be called uulzappy secondly, tlzat the same may be said ofyou.

As to thefirst, in spite qf tlte circumstances, l assure you tlzat l am
not unhappy and am even beyond tlze πται-[ι of unhappz'ness.

ἓ 1. 12. magno animo, ‘in a courageous spirit.’

13- circumscribere, ‘to cheat‘: cf. Epp. 87, 41 satius est
expugnare anectus, non circumscribere. The proper meaning of
circumscm'ptio is ‘cheating in business': cf. Epp. 97, 11 laetatur

ille circumscrzfflione furtoque: here it is metaphorical.

16. quos contingo‘, ‘to whom'I am related⁷: sanguine or·
some such word is almost always found with the verb in this
sense.

17. ne tuam quidem cet. ε as Sen. is the chief sufferet, ne
quidem here does not mean ‘not even,' but ‘also not,' there being
no idea of comparison between the things negatived : cf. De Ben.
iv 9, 2 we ought to select the recipients of our benefits, quod ne
agricolae quidem semina harenis committant (farmers also do not
plough the sand) : there, ‘not even’ would imply that sarmers know
less of agriculture than other people: so here, ‘not even’ would
imply that Helvia had more to bear than her son.

ξ 2. 19. hoc, used for id, is the antecedent of quod: otherwise
illud would be used for ‘the first point’ of two to be proved.

pietas, ‘love‚' said of either parents or children.

20. me premi, ‘that I am erm-hed?

21. putat has pietas lucz for subject: but it is probably a
copyist’s error sor putas.

22. at, ‘yet‚⁷ ‘at least.’

mihi ipse placebo, ‘I shall be proud of myself': sibi placere
aliqua re has generally a bad sense, ‘to be conceited about a
thing⁷1 cf. Mart. vii 76 quod tc dz'mfimzt (seranible sor you)

potentiores, Ι ...nolito nimium tihi placere: Ι delectas, Philomuse, non
amaris.
