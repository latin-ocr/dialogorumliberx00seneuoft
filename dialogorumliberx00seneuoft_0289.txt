NOTES (c. 18 ξ 2) 221

caduca mm mfnus quam ψεῖ homines occidunt desinuntque ; Mart. x
ε’, 9 marmora Messalae findit caprzjz'cas.·..l. 11 at chartis nec furta
nocent el mesula prosunt, Ι solaque non norunt lmen· monimenta mori.

9. uetustas, ‘futurity' : see n. to Paul. 15 ἕ 4. The last four
words have fallen into a metrical form: so Suet. lul. 44 siccare
Pomptinas paludes.

cetera, τὰ μὲν ἄλλα, is in contrast with the next clause.

10. constructionem lapidum ε such as the Pyramids.

et...aut: either et...et or autfflant would be more normal, as
three distinct forms of monument are referred to.

marmoreas moles: the most famous of these was the Mauso-
leum, the magnificent tomb erected about 350 B.C. at Halicarnassus
by Artemisia for her husband Mausolus. At Rome too there was
a great Mausoleum built by Augustus for the imperial family.

11. terrenos tumulos must, like the other two phrases, refer
to a sepulcra] monument: the Romans must have known the great
grave-mounds which still exist in Etruria.

12. propagant, ⁶ prolong‚' ought to have memoriam as an
object; but Sen. prefers a less obvious expression.

quippe, ‘for’: its regular meaning in Latin poetry. For the
thought, cf. Pliny and Martial quoted above 3 Juv. 10, 146 data sunt
ipsis quoqnefata sepulsrz's.

13. ingenii memoria, ‘the fame conferred by genius.' Statius
osten makes this eomparison in his dirges for the dead: Sz'lu. iii
3, 34 lu messes Cilicumque Arabumque superbas Ι merge rogz's.·...nos
non arsura feremus Ι vulnera, maturosque tuus durabit z'n annos, Ι
me monstrante, dolor3 ib. v 1, 10 sed mortalis honos, agilis quem
dextra laborat (i.e. painting and sculpture)‚ Ι nos tibi...l0nga nec
obscurum finem latura perenn-i Ι temptamus dare iusta lyra ‚·...lzaud
alio melius condere sepulcro.

14. largire, ‘bestow in abundance' : the word is more com-
plimentary than da would be, because it suggests that Pol. has a
boundless power to bestow immortality.

conloca: fame is spoken of as a tomb, as by Statius above.

15. duraturo cet. ε triple antithesis, of epithet‚ verb, and noun.

ξ 3. 17. causa : Fortune is the prisoner at the bar, Polybius the
judge, whose mind is for the present prejudiced by his grief: cf. Dz'al.
vi 1, 1 nec spem consepsi-sem, lam iniquo tempore, tam inimico iudice
