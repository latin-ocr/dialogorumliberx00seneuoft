17. capitis is governed by salute as well as by decore: caput is
used in two senses: (1) his head3 (2) his civil existence: the
meaning is that he would rather be convicted of serious crime than
have his hair badly cut.

18. non comptior esse malit quam honestior, ‘would not
prefer well—dressed hair to a good character’: comptus magis quam
honestus would be more normal, as the double comparative is
properly used when both qualities are present but the second is
smaller in amount. honestior clearly refers here to moral worth,
not appearance.

19. inter pectinem speculumque: cf. Epp. 15, 3 homines inter
oleum es uinum occupati. A list of barbers’ implements (ferramenta
lonsoria) is given in Plaut. Cure. 577 at ita meae uolsellae (tweezers)
pecten speculum calamistrum (curling-tongs) meum Ι bene me amas-
sint meaque axicz'a (scissors) linteumque extersuz' (for wiping on).

cf. Polyb. 2 ἑ 6: it is used often by Quintilian of writing a
speech.

21. canticis, ‘airs‚’ ‘songs’z Martial (iii 63, 5) speaks of
(antica Nili and Gaditana as fashionable in his time.

operati sunt, ‘are engaged ἐ sor this verb, see Postgate
Journ. ofPlzz'l. xxvi 314 ε he argues that operatus was an adjectival
formation from opera, like dotatus from dos, and the verb operari a
later development. The verb is certainly rare: it is used by Pliny
several times of bees and ants (Nat. Hist. xi 17, 21, 50, 109), and of
eagles (ib. x 15) ε the earliest instance Ι have noticed is in a fragment
of Sen. (Haase iii p. 426) artificum operantium diis immortalibus.
For operalus, cf. De Bon. vii 14, 6; Epp. 117, 26.

¹22. rectum: the natural tone os the voice is called ⁴ straight*
in opposition to the ‘turns' (flexus) required by the tune: flexus
is probably a translation of καμπαί (cf. Aristoph. qubes 969), as the
