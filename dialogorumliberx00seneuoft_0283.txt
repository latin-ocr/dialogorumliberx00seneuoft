less surprising than the gen. and much less rare: cf. Petron. c. 5²

5. uiginti legionum: i.e. the army of Brutus and Cassius at
Philippi ε they were not all killed, as Sen. seems to imply.

tandum 7·ιῖξί sanguine coniuratorum esse.

ξ 3. 7. bis: yet only one bereavement of this kind is men-
tioned below3 and Claudius had only one brother, Germanicus,
the father of Caligula. After the repeated bis, the reference to
Germanicus alone leaves the sentence utterly lame. Ι have therefore
inserted amisi sororem, which might easily be lost owing to the
repeated word, and which explains him for Claudius had also a
sister, Livia or Livilla. As she was seduced by Sejanus and
poisoned her husband, her death (31 A.D.) was not a subject for
regret; and Sen.‚ if he referred to her here, realised no doubt that
the less said, the better. But not to mention her at all, after
writing bis cet„ would be to call special attention to her-a failure
in tact unworthy of Seneca. The insertion is supported to some
extent by sorores (i.e. Octavia and Livia) in 17 ἓ 3.

9. Germanicum: the son of Drusus and adopted son of
Tiberius. a man of many gists and unbounded popularity: he died
at Antioch, in his 34th year, in 19 A.D. Of the astronomical poem
of Aratus we possess a version in 686 hexmneters, which was written
by Germanicus

12. adfectum, ‘my feeling,’ the feeling being desiderium, ⁶ lov
and sorrow.'

relinquerem, ⁶ left undone.'

13. a bono fratre, ⁴ from a loving brother.'

14. in principe ι Claudius was not emperor then, nor likely to
be3 but love of antithesis has led Sen. astray.

ἕ 4. 15. parentem publicum, ‘the father of all men ' : a more
comprehensive title than pater patriae: as applied to Claudius by
the senate, it occurs in Pliny Epp. viii 6, 8 and 10, and is used again
and again of Trajan by Pliny himself in his Panegyris (cc. 10, 26,
67, 87).

18. petitura is strange here, because petere often means ‘to
. attack’: it has been proposed to read paritura.
