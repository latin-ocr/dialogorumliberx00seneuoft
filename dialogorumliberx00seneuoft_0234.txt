166 AD ΡΑ VLINVM

huius mundi, ‘of this world‚⁷ consisting of earth, sea, and sky
with the stars. The heaviest part of this complex is the earth,
comprising earth and water, which remains fixed at the centre,
poised on the lighter element of air. Of the four elements, fire is
the lightest, and therefore rises to the top of the unaldus, where it
forms the aether (the part of the sky above the moon) and the stars ;
in point of lightness aer comes next, and is found both above and
below the earth. This is the Stoic cosinology, attacked by Lucretius
(i 1083 soll.)‚ who argues (Ι) that there is no medium or centre
(i 1070), and (2) that it is inconsistent to suppose that fire and air
fly upwards, while the other two elements sink down.
