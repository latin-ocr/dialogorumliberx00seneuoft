the quaestorship in 19 A.D. ; we know that he reached
the consulship, because Pliny, while discussing the
advantage of sea-air for consumptives‚ happens to
mention that ‘ Annaeus Gallio after his consulship ’ made
a voyage to Egypt for the sake of his healthl.
It was earlier, however, in Gallio's career that an
incident occurred, which probably seemed to him of no
importance but has given him a singular place in the
history of the world. The Roman province of Achaia,
the country we know as Greece, was governed by a
Roman official, commonly an ex-praetor ; and in the
year 52 A.D. Gallio was the holder of this office.
Seneca, in one of his letters2, speaks oi a sever which
his brother caught in Achaia, and for which he tried the
effects of a voyage. And there is now further evidence
which establishes the fact, and fixes the date, of Gallio‘s
governorship. The French excavations at Delphi have
revealed four stone fragments which fit together and are
inscribed with a letter from Claudius to the town of
Delphi. The inscription, as restored, begins as follows:

his freedman Zosimus on a voyage to Egypt that he might be
enred of consumption (Epp. v 19, 6). .
