216 AD POL YBJVM

20. priuatas domos: cf. Juv. 6, 114 quid prinam domur, quid

22. puluinaria 2 couches on which the images of the gods and
the deified emperors were placed in temples and carried at the
pompa Circensz's (the procession before the races): they were one
of the attributes of divinity.

25. seu-exiget, ‘will foreeqher way': the phrase is unusual

ire intenderat, perget' (Advers. ΙΙ p. 403).

F’age 55

1. iniuriae causa, ‘in order to wrong them 'z causti has
generally this final soree.

⁷. per templa aditur: the meaning is uncertain. Sen. may
refer to the many temples which stood on the Palatine Hill—those
of Victory, Jupiter Stator, Augustus himself, and the great temple
of Apollo (cf. Ovid Trz'sl. iii 1); or the reference may be to an
‘ improvement ’ of Caligula's ε Suet. Cal. zapartem Palatil'adfhrum
usque promouit‚...aede Castoris et Pollucis in uestibulum Iram-
stgnrata: this building may have remained 111 the early part of
Claudius' reign.

laureatis foribus: this privilege, granted by the senate to
Augustus, was retained by all his successors. Aug. thought it of
sufficient importance to include in his record of res gestae: cf. silon.
Aac. c. 34 senatus consulto Aug. appellatus sum, et laureis postes
aedium mearum uestiti (this word is doubtful, all but the first letter
being erased) publice, coronaque (inira super ianuam meamfixa esf.
Mommsen (p. 150 of his edition) discusses whether the door-posts
were adorned with laurel-wreaths or had each a laurel-tree 111 front
of them, and inclines to the latter view, following the evidence of
coins and the poets, eg. Ovid silet. i 562 (Apollo speaking to
Daphne) postibus Augustis eadem fidissima custos Ι ante sores staltis
mediamque tuebere quercum (i.e. the corona cim'sa).

atram...induet uestem: unless this is metaphorical‚ it implies
that after a death in the imperial family the palace-doors were hung

with mourning.
