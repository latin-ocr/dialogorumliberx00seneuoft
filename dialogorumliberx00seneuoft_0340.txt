18, respexi, ‘ 1 10οκ back ³ x idion] requires the perf. in Latin,
the present in English.

paupertatis : objective gen.

solaciis: any consolations.

quoniam quidem· cf. Paul. 2 ξ 5; 15 ξ 4.

20. uiaticum exulum: we may infer that Seu. himself was not
badly off for attendance and comsorts, even in exile.

principum, ‘ of the chief 111611 111 1116 state ⁷ : what follows about
Homer and the philosophers, is a digression, which ends with ἓ 4.

21. Homero : apparently it was supposed that, being blind, he
must have had at least 0116 slave to lead him about.

Platoni : in Plato's will, recorded by Diogenes Laertius (iii 43),
four slaves and a maid-servant are mentioned.

22. Zeno, a native of Cyprus, founded the Stoic school at
Athens about 300 B.C.: he was a pattern of frugality, so that
Ζήνωνος ἐγκρατέστερος became proverbial.

eoepit: seen. to Polyb. 1 ξ 1.

rigida, ‘ unbending ’ : cf. Lucan ii 389 (of Cato) rzgz'a'z‘ seruator
honestz·; Hor. Epp. i 1, 17 (of the Stoie) uirtutis uerae custos
rigidusque satelles. 'so the Stoic, the Epicurean system was mollis

funeri defuis. extulit eum plebs, sextantibus conlalis 2'72 capita
(contributing two unciae apiece).

26. publicae gratiae expresses what Livy expresses better by
concordiae ciuium : Val. Max. (iv 4, 2) calls him arbiter publicae
salutis.

sequester is thus defined by Servius: aut medius inter duos
altercantes, aut apud quem aliquid ad tempus depom'lur. The
former sense, ‘ a 1nediato1·,' ‘a go-between‚' is required here.

27. Regulus: the same story is told by Livy periocha 18, and
val. Max. iv 4, 6 : the uilicus had died, and the mercennarius had
run off, taking the sarm-stock with him. Regard for his oath was
not the only virtue of Regulus: like a good Roman, he was also
careful of his property. “
