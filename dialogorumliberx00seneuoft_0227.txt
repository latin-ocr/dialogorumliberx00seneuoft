1. suffragatores: see n. to 7 ξ 7.

accusandi cet. : the man begins his career iu the courts as
a prosecutor of criminals (see n. to 6 ξ 1); next he is president
osa court (cf. Pliny Epp. vi 2, 7 quotiens ludica, quod uel saepius
facio quam dico) ; lastly he is president (quaesitor) of some special
commission (quaestio extraordinaria).

ξὸ. Marium caliga dimisit, ‘the boot let Marius go,F i.e.
M. ceased to be a common soldier, the callga being a notable part
of Roman uniform ; cf. I'liny Nat. Hist. vii 135 Ventidium iuuen-

to describe the subsequent troubles of Scipio, not his early suc-

cesses: the copyist has assimilated the tense to reuocabitur just

Haase removed this difficulty by reading z'ztit3 but this is an
antiquated form which Sen. would hardly use. Ι have therefore
