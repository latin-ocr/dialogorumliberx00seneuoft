xviii JNTRODUCTJON

in his eyes eloquenee was at once wisdom and virtue.
But Seneca was not himself leading the life which he
pressed upon Paulinus; and we need not wonder that
Paulinus apparently went on his way entirely unaffected
by the sermon.

Yet the time came when Seneca did himself practise
what he here preaches. In the year 62 A.D. he sought an
interview with Nero and resigned ¹his position and
offered to resign his wealth. The dialogue which passed
between them is recorded in detail by Tacitus1. But
he took this step too late to save his reputation. Before
he went into retirement, this preacher of the simple life
had amassed a colossal fortune2; this upholder of Stoic
virtue, if he was not an actual accomplice, had at least
defended some of the most appalling of Nero’s crimes&
During the thirteen years from 49 to 62 A.D., Seneca must
have been as much occupatus as any man ever was.

The best thing in the treatise is the passage4 in which
Seneca speaks of the hardships and slights which men
will undergo, in order to associate, even on humiliating

facimus. quantulum enim studiis impertimur! alias horas
uanus salutandi labor, alias datum fabulis otium, alias specta—
cula, alias conuiuia trahunt. adice tot genera ludendi (the
complication of athletic sports) et insanam corporis curam,
peregrinationes, rura, calculorum anxiam sollicitudinem, in-
uitamenta libidinum, et uinum, et flagrantibus omni genere
uoluptatum animis ne ea quidem tempora idonea, quae
supersunt.

³ The worst of Nero's atrocities, the divorce and murder
of Octavia, took place in 62 A.D. after Seneca had retired into
private life. But the poisoning of Claudius in 54 A.D.‚ and
of Britannicus in 55, and the murder of Agrippina in 59,
have each left a stain on Seneca's name.
