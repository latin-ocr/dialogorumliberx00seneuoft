for failing to notice them.’

4. esse aliquem, ‘to think that there is a man, ..l'z infinilz'uus
indzg’nantzssv. .

ἓ 9. 6. inponas, ‘on'e ought to apply to him': the 2‘nd pers.
of the pres. subj. is constantly used as an imperative3 in Cicero it
usually expresses a general maxim, e.g. De Off iii 82, where
εὐσεβεῖν χρεών is translated by pietatem colas3 and so here3 but
later writers use it also in particular injunctions.

8. est here occurs six times in four lines and ends four following
clauses: cf. Polyb. 5 ἓ 33 14 ἓ 3: though unpleasing to a modern
ear, this can hardly be unintentional : perhaps it is studied negligence.
The tendency to break established rules of composition is marked in
Sen. z he despises the commonplace.

9. habitus, ‘ positions ² of sitting or standing.

10. dominus esse, ‘to have control over': cf. Livy ix 18, 16,

It is possible that this chapter is a covert satire upon the tastes
of the emperor Claudius: see Introd. p. xv.

ξ 1. 11. quorum is far separated from uitam, to which it
belongs: Sen. affects this form of hyperbaton: cf. quid...uolztp-
tatis (7 ἓ 9); quorum...modulatio (12 ξ 4).

12. latrunculi, lit. ‘soldiers‚’ a name for the ‘men’ (calculi,
πεσσοί) with which this game was played on a board (tabula): the
precise rules cannot be determined; but, that the players ‘took'
each other’s pieces, is clear from Dial. ix 14, 7: Kanus, when
summoned for execution, numm-anit calculos et sodali suo ‘uide'
inquit ⁴ ne post morlcm meam mentiaris le uicisse? tum adnuens
