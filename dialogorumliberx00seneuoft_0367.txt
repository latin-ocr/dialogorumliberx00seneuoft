NOTES (c. 19 § 5) 299

15. inbecillitatis, of her SeX.

16. eaput—obiecit: a piece os rhetoric: if a storrn came on
when her husband was lying dead on board, she did not deserve
praise sor that ; she might well deserve pity.

Gertz inserts uiri aster sepu1tura; it seems wanted to balance
suum, and could easily have fallen out after -τινα,

18. quae se—›deditz Alcestis : of the Latin poets, at least Ovid,
Statius, Martiah Juvenal, and Seneca himself (Medea 666) praise
Alcestis.

19. hoc is, I think, nominative. Here again there is some
sophistiy, because Alcestis faced certain death and Seneca's aunt
did not: the periculum was not par.

ξ 6. 21. post hoc nemo miretur : the mss. give miratum but
the subjunctive is the natural mood here, as the virtues of so re-
served a lady cannot have been a matter of general knowledge.
Sen. means z ‘let none be surprised, when I tell them that... 'z for
similar phraseS, cf. Polyb. 16 ξ 4 nemo itaque (zpost llos) mz‘relm·;
ibid. 1 1 ξ 2 pl'orsus non mz'rerz's; Epp. 108, ²9 non est qnod mia-erim
Pliny Nat. Hz'st. xxx 1 nemo mz'relztr. For post llos, ef. Epp. 78, 19
uz's tu post lzoc dolorem deridere l '

22. Aegyptum...optinuit: cf. Tac. Hz‘st. i 11 Aegyptum iam
inde a diuo Auguslo equites Romani obtinent loso regum: this
governorship was one of the chief posts open to equites. It is
remarkable that the name of this man, though he held the office
for so long, is unknown: Lipsius argues for Vitrasius Pollio, who
died in 32 A.D. : Sen. mentions one Balbillus, a governor of Egypt,
and calls him nit-orum optimus, and possibly this may be his uncle.
The absence os dates makes identification impossible.

24. domum suam: the omission of the preposition is normal:
so domi suae, ‘at her house.'

petiit, either for herself or for some petitioner: many cases are
recorded in which a governor's wife took bribes and sold her hus-
band's decisions: cf. Juv. 8, 127 sz' tibi sancta colun-s comitum, sz'
nemo tribunal l uendit ocersecomes (miluom), si nullum in coniuge
crimen, Ι nes per conuentus et cuncta per oppida curuis 1 unguibus
ire parat nummos raptura Celaeno.

25- loquax has the sense of dicax, ‘saucy.'

²7· culpam, ‘ moral guilt.’
