NOTES (e. 13 ξ 1) 141

pflazball games: the main object was throwing and catching:
cf. De Ben. ii 32, 1 sicut in lusu cst aliquid, pilam scite ac dz'lzgrenter
excipere, sed non dicitur bonus lusor, nisi qui apte et expedite remisit
quam acceperat3 ibid. ii 17, 3-—6-

excoquendi cet.: the practice of ‘baking' the skin by exposing
it to the sun was often prescribed by doctors for elderly people: see
Mayor on Juv. 11, 203.

13. consumpsere uitam: the whole of their life has been thus
spent: this emphatic use of consumere is common in Sem„ and the
application to abstract things as well as concrete seems almost
peculiar to him: cf. De Clam. i 14, 1 nemo (pater) ad supplicia
exigenda peruenit, nisi qui remedia consumpsit (until he has tried
every remedy) 3 Dial. ii 8, 3 maximum illud, in quo imperium suum
Fortuna consumit (does her worst) ; ib. 18, 5 quae uilia numquam in
uno homine ct z'n una contumelia consumuntur (entirely used up).
The same use of the word is common in the tragedies of Sem: cf.
Phaedra 958 (Theseus says) nunquam supremum numinis munus
tui Ι consumeremus (I would not have used up); Agant. 735 For-
tuna uires ipsa consumpsit suas (all her power). But Aledea 122
adeone credit omne consumptum nefas (is Jason so sure that I have
no crime left to commit ?) is different3 for part of the peculiarity is
the use os consumere without the addition of such a word as omne.
Outside Seu„ Ι have not noted it except in Tac. Hist. iii ²4 cgno-
minz'am consumpsistis (you have reached the lowest depth of
disgrace).

(The Thesaurus supplies two further instances of the same use :
Ovid Her. vi 161 cum mare, cum terras consumpserit, aera temptet3
Sil. Ital. ix 47 consumitur ira Ι Fortunae.)

14. habent, ‘involve.’

nam=further: a particle of transition. ‘When something has
been affirmed of several particulars, one of which the same thing ·
holds true still more evidently, osten follows with nam’ Mayor
on Juv. 10, 204: so this nam is much the same as ‘of course.'

16. quae,= ‘of whom,’ is attracted, as often, to agree with the
predicate manus.

§ 2. 17. Graecorum iste morbus fuit, ‘it was once a foible
confined to the Greeks' : fuit has emphasis. morbus: a common
word with Sen. and others for ‘ruling passion,' ‘hobby‚’ often with
