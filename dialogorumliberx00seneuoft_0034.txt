the nature of the tiger's cub he had been nurturingl.
We have been told, on high authority, that it ‘shows
gross ignorance of human nature, not to know that a
man may be very sincere in good principles without
having good practice²'; but in Seneca's case the dis-
crepancy is so glaring that it is hard to shut our eyes
to it. His writings are full of praise ior the uncom-
promising virtue of the Stoics; but'one period of his
own lise—and we know little of any other period—is
stained first by flattery of little men in great power, and
then by connivance at the monstrous crimes of an in-
human tyrant. He makes a poor figure beside such a
man as Thrasea. When Nero, after one blundering
attempt, succeeded in murdering his mother, the case
for his defence was written by Seneca and sent from
Naples in a despatch to the senate. When the wretched
senators began to pass votes of congratulation to Nero
and thanksgiving to the gods, Thrasea refused to take
any part in such work: he rose and left the house.
Thrasea, probably, could not have said such elever things
in praise of virtue ; but he could face death rather than
countenance the abominations of Nero ³.

Seneca was the most eloquent speaker, the most
famous writer, of his time; but, of the Stoic life and
character there were far nobler representatives among
the Roman senators. Who can say of him, what Gibbon
says of Marcus Aurelius that ‘his life was the noblest
commentary on the precepts of Zeno' ?

N erom‘ in Palatium adductus saeuum immanemque natum et sen-

66 A.D. when he was forced to commit suicide.
