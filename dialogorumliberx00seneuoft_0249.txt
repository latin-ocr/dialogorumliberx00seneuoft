NOTES (e. 4§ 1) 181

12. >causa=by the goodness of his cause: this, like affusam,
is taken from the language of the laweourt-

13. parcunt, ‘let off’; remittunt, ‘reduce the penalty': see
n. to Paul. 13 ξ 4.

14. iuis=rozs ἐκεῖ, ‘to the dead.’

16. primo quoque tempore, ‘as soon as possible’: this phrase,
which many Latin writers use, is remarkable because quisquc does
not bear its usual distributive sense: optimus quisque is ‘all the best
men’3 but primo quoq. temp. refers to one time only, the earliest
time.

17. inanibus has the emphasis: ‘from what cannot console?

amara libidine dolendi: persistence in grief gives a morbid
pleasure to the bereaved z ef. Dz'al. vi 1, 7Jit z'zfilz'cz's animi praua
uoluptas dolor.

ἓ 2. 19. ratio: reason should put an end to sorrow : cf. 18 §6.
The usual argument is, that time will do so, if reason does not, and
this is unworthy of a rational being: cf. Cic. Ad Ast. xii 1ο, 1 can-
solalionum multae uiae, sed illa rectissima .· impetret ratio quod dies
(time) impetratura est. But Sen. here says that, if reason does not
dry our tears, the state of human lise (fortuna) will not.

22. ambitio, ‘ ambition,’ the motive os the man who seeks
advancement: it :petitio honorum ι cf. Paul. 2 ξ 1.

²3· optauerat, ‘ he had prayed for ⁷: see n. 10 Paul. 4 ξ 1.

24. uoto suozthe granting of his prayer ι abl. of cause.

ἓ 3. 28. quae—uoluit, ‘ when she decreed that the first weeping
of mankind should be the weeping of their birth-time' : it would be
clearer, if Sen. had written primam nasccntium hominnm uocem
fletum esse uolztz't; but he prefers the ingenious to the simple.

For two famous examples of this thought, cf. Lucr. v 222 tum
porro puer, ut saeuis proiectus ab undis 1 nauita, nudus hmnz' iacet
infans, indzgrus omni Ι uitali auxilia„‚uagituque locum lugubri colaz-
pla, ul aecumst 1 cui tantum in uita restet transire malarum ; Pliny
Nat. Hist. vii 2 hominem tantum nudum et in nuda humo natali die
abicit (Natura) ad uagitus statim et ploratum, nullumque lot ani-
malium aliud ad lacrimas, et has prolz'mcs uitae principio.
