THE TEXT OF THE D1AL0GUEs: A AND s.

The works of Seneca, universally read during his
life—time, fell into disrepute soon after his death. The
great authority of Quintilian which was against him must
have carried much weight; and the archaic revival‚
which carried all before it soon after Quintilian’s time,

especially by two Danish scholars, the illustrious Madvig
and his pupil M. (Ἴ. Germ, who, alike in knowledge of
